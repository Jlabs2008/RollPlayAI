Cosmic Convergence: The New Era
This is the 2nd part of the story, MORE CONTEXT!


Cosmic Convergence: THE NEW ERA begins here:
Ryker: “As my last act, I shall erase all powerful beings from existence. Goodbye.” *does what he said* Secret Author: “I’m here. And everywhere.”
Scientist: *Is then destroyed*
Radharc: “FINALLY I CAN STOP RUNNING FROM HIM” *Then proceeds to walk back to nightfall*
*The eternal being feels all but 1 of his iterations destroyed 
As the dust settles…a loud crying noise is heard
Radharc: “What was that?”
Cancer:”maybe a giant baby”
Rae: “ where have you been?”
Cancer:”Finding popcorn”*eats a bite of popcorn* 
Crying Intensifies
Radharc: *Walks over to crying sound* “It happened!”
You see a small youth on the ground bawling.
Radharc: “Hello”
Youth: “Who you?”
Xin: “ who, where am, huuuu?” 
Cancer:”Im Cancer and I want to know who you are”
Youth: “I not talking to you…I talking to old guy.”
Cancer:”Who's the old guy?”
Youth: *points at Radharc*
Cancer:”yeah he’s old”
Radharc: “I am Radharc, who are you?”
Youth: “I….don’t know.” *pauses* “You are a stupid head!” *kicks him in the shin and looks at Rae* “What that noise? The bzzzzzz”
Rae: “ what buzz?” 
Meanwhile in SOUR chaos unfolds as SOUR leaks into universe A1, and is thrown into an apocalyptic scenario with all of the Rykers fighting for superiority. Wiziker is at the front of this battle, taking control of SOUR with Snape (Girl, Mimick, Axolotl and Smile were killed in the great purge)
Rae: “ I’ve got to go brb.” * grabs Rain and teleports them both back to the orphanage Rain came from.* 
Rain: “ I guess this is goodbye.”
Rae: * smiles.* “ for now.”
Rain : “ I want to turn out just like you!”
Rae: “ You will.” * Freezes time, takes Rain back to her room,  erases her memory, revives the two girls Ryker killed, restarts time, and walks away before unfreezing time. Teleports back.* 
Youth: “Where buzz girl?”
Rae: “ right here.” 
Youth: “You hear buzz?”
Rae: “ Yeah, from everyone, but I think it sounds more like a hum.”
Youth: “Why your buzz so loud? Be more quiet!” *looks around* “STOP BUZZING PEOPLES!”
Hestuia: *appears*”Hey guys.” *looks at Youth* “Hey R…”
Youth: *looks at Rae* “Who he? And why he call me R…”
Hestuia: “I’m Hestuia, and I speak for the trees.”
Rae: “ One I can’t really make my hum be quieter and second is this Ryker?” 
Hestuia: “Um…sorta….? Not the Ryker you know.”
Rae: “ uhh, weird.” 
Ryker: “He talking about me? My name Ryker?”
Rae: * nods.* 
Ryker: “Okay? How he know my name and I don’t?”
Rae: * shrugs.* “ No clue but he knows a lot of weird stuff so I’m not surprised.” 
Ryker: “You know stuff about me?”
Rae: “ I know another version of you. I think he died?” 
Hestuia: *clears throat* “Well…um no. This is him.”
Rae: “ ummm, ok?” 
Ryker: “You keeping secrets from me?”
Rae: “ I won’t do that. I promise.” 
Ryker: “So why you think I die?”
Rae: “ because he killed all really powerful beings and his home is falling apart.” 
Ryker: “I’m sorry Tree guy! What happened to Tree guys home?”
Rae: “ not his home. The place you build when you're older.” 
Ryker: “I not like work.”
Rae: “ don’t worry I don’t think it will take too much.” 
Ryker: “Why not? Me not strong. And how you know my future.”
Rae: “ I knew you when you were older.” 
Ryker: “That make no sense.” *pauses* “Unless you time traveler! You could mess with space-time continuum!”
Rae: “ I could. But I don’t. I prefer not to. Though I’m not a time traveler.”
Ryker: “Well I not a time traveler. I think.”
Rae: “ nope.” 
Ryker: “Well then how? That makes no sense.”
Rae: “ I don’t really understand it either.” 
Ryker: “So then how? And who will I become? An architect?”
Rae: “ nope. A paradox.” 
Ryker: “A paradox? You can’t become a paradox, you just are one…so are you lying to me?” 
Rae: “ no. I promised.  Besides, why would I have any reason to lie to you? And I think that you are a paradox because that’s how you're a kid again.”
Without the multiversal gem powering the facility, Aperture begins to shut down once again.
Radharc: “We have to get out of here like now! Many universes are unraveling” *Hands everyone a note: “DO NOT TELL HIM ANYTHING, IF WE TELL HIM CHAOS WILL UNFOLD! LET ME HANDLE THIS”*
Radharc: “Follow me, I know an emergency exit. Only come with me if you can not teleport, or if you have more then one being in your mind, Ryker, you should be fine just stay next to me” *He walks over to a door that has a strange symbol on the door handle* “First, rae go through the door it is going to lead you in to a dark hallway, then me and Ryker will go down it, xin, you will need to just teleport away”
A room collapses
Radharc: “GO”
Radharc grabs Young Ryker and they go through the door. A strange song plays as they walk out the door, then they appear at Nightfall then Radharc walks back and grabs Rae.
Radharc: “Are you okay?”
Rae: “ yeah?” 
Ryker: “Where are we old guy?”
Radharc: “Welcome to Nightfall, aka my base”
Ryker: “Nightfall? I…?”
Radharc: “This place is one of the few safe places while everything resets. Along with a few other universes”
Ryker: “Like?”
Radharc: “All universes that were not linked to the crystal and anything that is not in the Z section”
Ryker: “Do you know me? Like older me?”
Radharc: “I wish they would not have told you that, yes, I did.”
Ryker: “Why does buzz girl know about me?”
Radharc: “This is complicated, are you sure you want to hear it?”
Hestuia: *suddenly here* “It’s more complicated than all of you think.” *chuckles*
Ryker: “Does tree guy know something that you don’t old guy?”
Radharc: “No, it is just like, insanely complicated, I do not think you would understand at this point.”
Ryker: “I don’t know, I’m smarter than the average 3 year old.”
Radharc: “Okay, I can explain some of it, follow me” *begins to walk to a hall of mirrors*
As Ryker walks by, you see Aiolos on the other side of the mirror, or older Aiolos, doing what Ryker is. Ryker doesn’t notice.
Radharc: “Welcome to the hall of mirrors” *Pauses for effect* “I will show you the basics of what is happening” *Touches a lag mirror and around him some of Radharks memories are displayed but the really bad and confusing stuff is censored out.* “That is the basics of what happened, but you are different.”
Ryker: “Huh?”
Radharc: “Do you have any questions you would like to ask?”
Ryker: *face goes blank, and eyes glow white* “Don’t try to explain this to him. He can’t handle it.” *he returns to normal* “So what are you going to show me?”
Radharc: “I wanted to show, to your room.” *Walks to a door* “All you need to do is think of a room plan and it will appear, though, I need to be in the room if you want to change it.” *Thinks to himself “Hopefully he doesn't want a room that is inside of antimatter, Scientists old room at bound was made of it and it took me weeks to create!”*
Ryker: “Why was that hard?”
Radharc: “How did you, never mind, it is because I can not make antimatter exist very Easily”
Ryker: “All right.” *pauses* “I want a room. Preferably one with a pickle.” 
Radharc: “Okay, well, how about something like this”*TapsCain and a room apiers it is a large room with plain white walls, and one blue accent wall, the bed is white with red accents. In the corner there is a red throne with stuffed animals next to it. The room also has a large library with books of every type.*
Ryker: “Where’s the throne?”
Radharc: “It is in the corner”
Ryker: “I see no pickle.”
Radharc: “Just go down to the kitchen and grab one, if you need anything just let me know”
Ryker: “I’ve been lied to.”
Radharc: “Fine” *A pickle appears on his throne*
Ryker: “I’m bored.”
An alarm goes off a voice comes over the intercoms and says “Emergency in multiverse, come to the control room for details”
Ryker: “I love die tales.”
Radharc: “If you want you can come with me” *begins to run over to the control room*
Ryker: *waddles over with Radharc*
Meanwhile
Rae: “ 🕈︎︎♏︎︎●︎︎●︎︎ ❍︎︎⍓︎︎ □︎︎◻︎︎⧫︎︎♓︎︎□︎︎■︎︎⬧︎︎ ♋︎︎❒︎︎♏︎︎ 🙵♏︎︎♏︎︎◻︎︎ ⧫︎︎♒︎︎♏︎︎ ❍︎︎◆︎︎●︎︎⧫︎︎♓︎︎❖︎︎♏︎︎❒︎︎⬧︎︎♏︎︎ ♓︎︎■︎︎⧫︎︎♋︎︎♍︎︎⧫︎︎ □︎︎❒︎︎ ♌︎︎❒︎︎♏︎︎♋︎︎🙵 ♋︎︎ ◻︎︎❒︎︎□︎︎❍︎︎♓︎︎⬧︎︎♏︎︎ ♋︎︎■︎︎♎︎︎ ●︎︎♓︎︎♏︎︎ ⧫︎︎□︎︎ ♋︎︎ ♍︎︎♒︎︎♓︎︎●︎︎♎︎︎📬︎︎ ✋︎︎❍︎︎❍︎︎♋︎︎ 🙵♏︎︎♏︎︎◻︎︎ ❍︎︎⍓︎︎ ◻︎︎❒︎︎□︎︎❍︎︎♓︎︎⬧︎︎♏︎︎.”
Cancer:*appears*”’ello”
Rae: “ hi.”
Cancer:*pat pat on Raes head*
Rae: “ …… why?”
Cancer:”because reasons”
PI: “It is best that you do not mess with the matrix of the universe, only if someone else is to mess with it then you have the permission/reason to do so.
Rae: “ I REFUSE!”
Cancer:”I will alter the universe:)”*Vanishes, appears by baby Ryker*
Back at nightfall
Cancer:*appears by small ryker staring down upon him*”Hello tiny ryker, would you like to be punted into the wall as hard as I can?”
Ryker: *looks at Cancer* “No thank you.”
Cancer:”awww, ok” 
Radharc:”HOW DARE YOU TRY TO HARM HIM”*The atoms around her shift and she is launched out of night fall and she can not figure out how to get back in*
Cancer:*voids into inbetween, returns to nightfall*”really, I was joking, i’m not going to kick a three year old”
Radharc: “leave now or you will regret it”
Cancer:”Now what does ryker think of that?”
Radharc:”Uses his power and cancer forgets about nightfall and is sent to the void”
Ryker: “Um…”
Radharc: “If you do not leave I am afraid if you do not leave now I will have to enforce the rules of nightfall”
Cancer:*is confused, finds ryker and returns*”What was that for? I’m not going to kick a small child, do you think that I am a monster? And what are these rules exactly?”
Radharc: “Section 1 clause 2 if any being tries to or threatens any one who seeks shelter here is hear by banished from nightfall; I am willing to let you stay but you will be required to read the rules of Nightfall”
Cancer:”well I wasn’t even going to try to kick a small child, I do have morals”
Radharc: “Yes but even if you will not you still threatens to do it which is”
Cancer:”yes I can read a book/whatever format the rules are in, I will read your rules of nightfall, may I have them?”
Radharc: “Hear is the rule book for visitors”*Hands her a 5,000 page book, it also contains the history of nightfall*
Cancer: “Nice book, where do the rules begin, or are they mixed in?”*hefts book*
Radharc: “You need to read the whole book to start with, by the way here is the rules of night fall for people staying hear Ryker”*Hands him a piece of paper with 2 rules, 1.Do not sneeze in the no sneeze room* 
Ryker: *rolls eyes* “I can’t read old guy.”
Radharc: “The only rules are do not sneeze in the no sneeze room, and do not stay up past 2 am, you also need to listen to Radharc ”
Cancer:”how about you read it to him. Also I think that this big book is all history.”*looks at book* 
Radharc: “No, only 2 pages are history, visitors just have way more rules then people that are Residing here.”
Cancer:”Well that's quite interesting, would you mind explaining?”
Radharc: “Ryker is taking refuge here, you are just visiting here temporarily, he is staying here for a long term. ”
Cancer:”no the difference in rule length”
Radharc: “He is staying head long term and he has residency here so there are almost no rules, but you do not have any residency so there are more rules.”
Cancer: *grumbles*”fine”*voids away to watch and read THE book”
Xin: “ hi my name is xin and WHAT IS GOING ON.”
Cancer:*appears*”I have a sneaking feeling that you shouldn't be here. Just a sneaking one.”*returns to inbetween*
Xin: “ Well I might as well let Querith learn for me.” * has a seizure as he changes.*
Ryker: “Can I have some strawberry milk?”
Querith * oozes out metal to form a goblet. “ Do you have milk?”
Ryker: “NO! I have a pickle!”
Querith.: “okay” *starts working on a cristal*
Intern of the universe: “Here is your strawberry milk mr ryker.”
Ryker: “Who you?”
Intern of the universe:”I am the last intern”
Cancer:*appears*”Yeah you make no sense, I’m halfway through my book!”*holds up 5,000 page book, vanishes again to watch and read*
Querith * holds up a glowing crystal.* “By now” banishes the intern to a plane of existence that he can't leave.*
Radharc: “XIN and Querth, did you just disrespect the strawberry milk! Also, welcome to nightfall”
Querth: *offended* “ don't compare me to that buffoon.”
Radharc:”Would you like a toure?”
Querith: “No thank you.”
Radharc: “Also, how did you get in hear, the only way in is this door, there is no other way except if you travel with 4th dimension”
Ryker: “So…what was that alarm?”
Radharc:”Oh yah, we should probably check, that means that…”
Ryker: *sips strawberry milk* “Eh..not worth the hype.”
Fourth Wall: “How? I’m alive?”
THE Author: “I’m not explaining myself.”
Fourth Wall: *breaks funny bone*
Radharc:”To the control room” 
Ryker: “I has't hath reached anoth'r leveleth of sophistication”
Querith: “I have”
Radharc: “Have you been reading too much”
Ryker: “I don’t know how to read.”
Radharc: “NO, NO, NO, sector 5 is on fire again”
Ryker: “I go to sector 5 now.” *starts waddling there*
Radharc: “That is off limits, let me put it out.”
Ryker: “I’m going!” *waddles after him*
Radharc: “No” *chases him to stairs*
Ryker: *waddles into endless random rooms eating things, and yodeling*
Radharc: *Picks up ryker* “No, time for dinner”
Ryker: ”Humph.”
Dream: * grabs book and starts ripping pages out and coloring on others.* 
Jaeger: *comes down for dinner* 
Ryker: “Who this new character?”
Jaeger: “Oh, cool, we have a child living here now.” *Starts eating*
Ryker: “I not a child! I a big boy!”
Jaeger: “Cool, what do you want to eat? A pickle? Also welcome to Nightfall. I will technically be your neighbor.”
Ryker: “This guy gets it.”
Dream: * steals Rykers pickle.*
Ryker: *starts throwing a fit*
Rae: “ ….you good?” 
Ryker: “Someone took my pickle!!!”
Rae: “ oh. Understandable.” * gives him another pickle.* 
Dream: * giggles.* 
Ryker: *frowns* “Humph.”
Rae: “ what?” 
Ryker: “I’m mad.”
Radharc: “How do people keep getting in here? Last time I checked the only way in here is with the door or if you can travel in 4d.” *pauses* “Wait a minute” *Pulls out laptop* “Let me see… OH, I left more entrances open then I thought. Wait, were any of you guys in sector 5?” 
Querith: “Why is your name Radharc? We may never know.”
Radharc: “Is toisc go bhfuil teanga níos fearr á labhairt agam.”
Rae: “ My bad i just wanted to see the kid but if you want I can leave.”
Cancer:*appears*”Well if you want, I can go to sector 5, and cause chaos and mayhem. Also, Dream, That wasn't the real book , plus I’m done anyways.”
Dream: * steals the book.* “ I'm making it easier to read.” * proseeds to rip some of the pages out and draw on others in red permanent marker.*
Cancer:”I don’t think that Radharc will be too happy about that, Where is small ryker anyways? And radharc”
Dream: “ So? I'm making his book interesting. I don’t know.” 
Cancer:*takes red marker and draws a mustache
 on Dream and gives marker back. * “I have now effectively made you as more interesting as you did the book”
As Cancer tries to color on Dream , the Marker passes through her.
Dream:” you really thought it Would be that easy?” 
Cancer:”Well, have your book and explain it to Radharc, plus, I think that there was something about no threats.”
Dream: “ I threatened no one.” * starts drawing on her arms.* 
Cancer:”ok, Hey scene, how about you come back now. That would be nice also, bring small ryker so we can play games. And so that you can kick Dream out”
Dream: * laughs.* “ I'm in my own dimension. He can't kick me out.”
Ryker: “Why are you talking to the person who stole my pickle!”
Cancer:”because she is annoying, also, Radarc just means scene in Irish. Plus, I will avenge your pickle.”*walks to the kitchen and grabs two pickles and gives one to a small ryker and eats the other.*
Dream: “ you could have just asked for it back.” * tosses him his Pickle.* 
Ryker: “TOO MANY PICKLES! I DON’T LIKE PICKLES!”
Cancer:”well would you like me to eat them? And make them disappear?”
Ryker: “NO! THEY’RE MY PICKLES!”
Dream: * Laughs.* “ oh my.. This kid’s GREAT!” 
Cancer:”well what do you want to do about it?”
Ryker: “FIX IT!”
Dream: “ yeah Cancer. Fix it.”
Cancer:”how?”
Ryker: “FIGURE IT OUT!”
Cancer:”then I will eat them because they are good.“
Ryker: “NO! THE PICKLES ARE MINE!”
Cancer:”then take your pickle daggers and put them in the fridge.”
Ryker: “BUT I DON’T LIKE PICKLES!”
Dream: “ How many pickles would you like?”
Cancer:”then why did you want pickles on a throne? How about you make a pickle family and go play”
Ryker: “I don’t WANT PICKLES!!!!!!!!!”
Cancer:”then put them away if you don’t want them. Do what you want with them as long as they aren’t in my ears.”*makes ears vanish*
Ryker: “Hey crazy voice lady! She can’t hear us now! LETS SAY MEAN THINGS ABOUT HER EATING MY PICKLE!”
Dream: “ YESSSS!!! Also I'm only 8.”
Cancer:”I can still hear you, my outer ears are just gone”
Ryker: “I'm three! AND I HATE PICKLES!”
Dream: “ That's a good age. And understandable.” 
Cancer:”SUMMON THE 53 YEAR OLD MAN NAMED SCENE IN IRISH”
Ryker: “YAY!” *runs around throwing his pickles at Cancer*
Dream : * throws pickles at cancer too.” 
Cancer:*summons armour*”let's dance around the fire and SUMMON HIM IN AREA 5”
Dream: “ aww but that was fun.”
Ryker: “She weird.”
Dream: “ yup.” * takes her skull mask off and starts drawing on it. Her face is pale and dirty. Her eyes are black with tiny red dots. She has sharp teeth.*
Cancer::”come, lets go the sector 5”
Ryker: “GO TO YOUR ROOM! YOU’VE BEEN VERY BAD!”
Cancer:”you aren’t my boss, also dream’s creepy, we should banish her from nightfall.”
Dream: “ you can't.”
Ryker: “She's less creepy than you!”
Dream : “ thankyou.” 
Cancer:”how?, I don’t have a room here”
Ryker: *sticks out tongue and runs away, opening random doors*
Cancer:”you should sneeze in the no sneezing room”*follows ryker*
Dream: * follows Ryker.*
Ryker: *looks around* “Well I’m BOOOORRRRRRRRRRREEEEEEEEEEED”
Cancer:”hello bored, im a tumor in your brain”

Ryker: “Your name weird! HAHAHA!”
Cancer:”yours is weird if you say it enough times.”
Ryker: “RYKERRYKERRYKERYKERYKERYKERYERKREYKERYK!”
Dream: “ perfect.” * Puts her skull back on. It's covered in marker along with her arms.*
Cancer:”yes”
Dream : “ Well bored, time to make things a little bit interesting.” * steals as much as she can from Cancer including her valuables off with it.* 
Cancer:”seriously?, Radharc, can you banish her because I believe that that is against the rules of nightfall”
PI: “Why do you need to banish people?”
Dream: * walks up to a mirror and somehow shoves all her stuff through the glass.* 
Radharc: “How did you get in here Dream?”
Dream: “ yes.” 
PI: *Goes back to house, comes back to others with nothing new.
Radharc: “You guys need to leave this area, It is not saf… open to the public”
Dream: “ never.”
Cancer:”I don’t care about safety, or whether or not it is open to the public.”
PI: “You guys, why don’t we just stop fighting and relax. IF you are calm you will be able to think better and win.
Radharc: “You are at the edge, please follow me to the other room”
Cancer:”please give good reasons to follow”
Dream: “ Can I have permission to take Cancers' valuables?”
Radharc: “If you guys do not leave this area, I am afraid you will have to leave, it is very dangerous, sector 5 is not meant for… those who can not see”
Cancer:”So what are we going to do about small ryker toddler mann, also, I can see, unless you are talking about something else, Scene.”
Dream : “ FIIIIIIIIIIINNNNNNNNNNNNNNEEEEEEE!!!”* Teleports to Ryker.*
Radharc: “Follow me pelas” *begins to walk back to the control room mumbles to himself:”Ní féidir ach iad siúd a chonaic an tús agus a fheicfidh an deireadh a fheiceáil go fírinneach”*
Querith: “Hey there ryker. [CENSORED]”
Querith: * voice is panicked* “xin please tell me you said that”.
Radharc: “WHO SAID THAT!” *Gives him note: “He can not know!”*
Radharc: “Does anyone want to watch random the movie #8.12?” *Secretly takes Rykers phone*
Ryker: “No! My magic box!”
Dream: * gives him a new one.* “ here you can have my back up.” 
Ryker: “No! I want my magic box!”
Querith * eyes start to glow as he convulses. He starts to breathe differently. Less controlled. He creates a sword and throws it full force at radharc.*
Ryker: “NO!!!!” *his eyes glow white, and the sword rotates back around at Querith. He then passes out.*
Dream: “ ohhhhhh FUN! We’re playing throwing swords.” * makes a sword appear and yeets it in a random direction.* 
Radharc: *says in a quiet and clearly furious voice* “Leave now, I am afraid I have not made the rules clear.” *begins to tremble* “We will now be entering a level 5 security protocol. Querith, I am afraid that I am going to have to ban you until further notice” *Picks up Ryker* “Táimid i mbaol, glasáil síos go dtí an 5ú leibhéal” *The air around them changes all entrances are closed* 
Radharc takes ryker to the infirmary and begins pulls a small lever
Radharc: “What is the problem”
Dochtúir: “It appears to be overstimulated, I am not sure why it triggered…”
Radharc: “I think I know why”
Ryker: *wakes up* “Where am I?”
Radharc: “Are you okay?”
Ryker: “How you not dead?”
Radharc: *Laughs* “It would take a lot more than a simple sword to kill me.”
Ryker: “Like a contract?” *pauses* “Where did that come from?”
Radharc: “No, I can manipulate atoms that are around me, I have trained myself for years for scenarios just like that. What is the last thing you remember?”
Ryker: “That guy shooting that knife at you.”
Radharc: “Okay, I think you passed out because you were startled by how sudden and unexpected that was. Do you need a drink or anything”
Ryker: “No, I don’t drink.”
Radharc: *Laughs* “I ment water or OJ”
Ryker: “I meant what I said.”
Radharc: “Okay” *Pauses* “I am not quite sure why he did it but I can promise you that It will not happen again.”
Ryker: *pauses* “Yes it will.” *pauses* “Hmph.”
Radharc: “I think it is time for you to go to bed.”
Ryker: “But it’s not dark outside yet…!”
Radharc: “It has never once been dark outside hear so…”
Ryker: “And?”
Radharc: “If you would like I can change the window so it looks like it is dark.”
Ryker: “I’m staying up until it’s dark. Humph.”
Radharc: “Trust me, you will want to go to sleep.”
Ryker: “No!”
Radharc: “If you go to sleep, I will give you a pickle tomorrow.”
Ryker: “I don’t like pickles!”
Radharc: “Fine, you can stay up, but you have to help me with something.”
Ryker: “No!”
Radharc: “You won't have to help me if you go to bed.”
Ryker: “You can’t force me to do anything!”
Radharc: “Then what do you want to do” *This whole time he has found this kind of funny*
Ryker: *shrugs* “I don’t know.”
Radharc: “Do you want to watch tv?”
Ryker: “What’s a TV?”
Radharc: “Let me show you” *Begins to walk into the hall of mirrors* “This is not true tv, I have terrible service down hear but, this is as close as we have” *Pulls out a small device and puts it on the floor* “This Is the only projector that I could find that still had a dvd reader on it” *Puts in dvd titled “Merry Popins”*
Ryker: “So how do you control the small people in the mirror?”
Radharc: *Laughs* “I am not controlling it, it is a recording of actors making a play”
Ryker: “What’s a Recording?”
Radharc: “Let me show you” *Pull out camara* “Say something”
Ryker: “Something.”
Radharc: *Plugs it into the projector and it plays it*
Ryker: “Why you copy me and put me in the magic mirror to make me say something?”
Radharc: “That is a recording, sort of”
Ryker: “You monster! Why would you imprison someone!”
Radharc: “That is not how a recording works it moving pictures”
Ryker: “Picture?”
Radharc: “Do you know what a painting is?”
Ryker: “A painting?”
Radharc: “Nevermind, anyways it is kind of just magic”
Ryker: *nods* “Dark magic. You evil.”
Radharc: *Rolls eyes* “No, there are not people in the mirror”
Ryker: “Look as I wave at the twin of me, he waves back.” *waves hand*
It doesn't wave back
Radharc: “That mirror is broken”
Ryker: “Twin! Are you okay! Is he forcing you to do things?”
Dream: * giggles.* 
Radharc: “Trust me I am not at all that powerful”
Dream: “ far from it.” 
Ryker: “I agree with creepy girl.”
Dream: “ I’m Dream.” 
Ryker: “Okay creepy girl.”
Dream: “ ok bored.” 
Ryker: “So can I have the magic button box back?”
Dream: “ if you call me by my name.” 
Radharc: “What is the magic button box Dream?”
Ryker: “The one that does the things.”
Dream: “ you mean this?” * pulls out Rykers phone.* 
Ryker: *nods*
Radharc: “Here, hand it to me”
Dream: * makes it disappear.* “no.” 
A flash of lightning appears and Wiziker appears in a cloud of smoke, dressed more powerfully
Wiziker: “I’ll be taking Ryker now.”
Radharc: “YOU DARE TO ENTER THIS SANCTUM I ENFORCE ALL CONTRACTS NOW LEAVE OR SUFFER THE CONSEQUENCES”
Wiziker: “You mean these contracts?” *pulls multiple warped text contracts*
Dream: * to Ryker.*“ get ready kid, this is going to be a good show.” 
Radharc: “No, there are no physical copies of this, you would need to kill ”
Wiziker: “Right. These are those. I’ll be taking Ryker back now.”
Ryker: “Who you?”
Wiziker: “Who’s this?”
Dream: “ this is bored.” 
Ryker: “Noooo! I Ryker!”
Wiziker: “What did they do to you?!”
Dream: * shrugs.* “ I didn’t do anything.” 
Wiziker begins to feel a burning sensation, the contracts in his hand burst into flame and the words blast into his head. A contract must break in only the dark, time must stop, all must break, when nothing can break us now!
Wiziker: “Well goodbye.”
Radharc: “You do realize that is not the contracts of time you fool.”
Wiziker: *teleports himself and Ryker to the fixed SOUR*
Radharc: “Time has began, I must enter sector 5”
Rae: * at SOUR.* “ Hey Wiziker. Hi kid.” 
Radharc: *Enter sector 5*
Ryker: “Where are we?”
Rae: “ this is the place that I called your home.” 
Ryker: “I built this? I not that strong!”
Wiziker: “Well of course you are. You just need to reunlock your abilities.”
Rae: * nods.* 
Ryker; “Abilities? You mean just listening to the buzzing? It tells me all sorts of things.”
Rae: * nods again.* “ Yeah, follow the buzz.” 
Ryker: “But the buzzing is so loud here! It’s coming from everywhere!”
Rae: “ hmmm interesting.” 
Wiziker: “Here.” *teleports them to a floating platform above A1’s crater*
Ryker: “What happened here?”
Wiziker: “A lot.”
Ryker: “But the crater….it’s huge.”
Wiziker: “3027789 miles to be precise.”
Ryker: “But why? Who would do this?”
Wiziker: “It was an accident.”
Ryker: *frowns*
Wiziker: “Anyways…what I want you to do is focus on one of the buzzing sounds, not coming from me. Got it?”
Ryker: “Yep!”
Wiziker: “Now, try to make that buzzing noise in your head.”
Ryker: “Bzzzzzzzzzzz”
Wiziker: “No. In your head.”
Ryker: *does so* “Okay now what.”
Wiziker: “Now flex that muscle in your brain.”
Ryker: *does so and copies Hestuia powers*
Hestuia: *invisible*
Ryker: *uses power, and his eyes start to glow the color of the text* “A prophecy is bestowed on all of you today. Beware on what you speak. Be careful what you say. Ryker could turn out just fine. Or once again repeat the loop and lose the story once again. You have an opportunity to influence his fate. That may be a lot to put on some of your plates. Depending what you do, whether that be good or bad. Just be careful what you wish for, or what you get is what you have.”
Wiziker: “What was That?”
Ryker: “What was What? Did I do something!”
Rae: “ You did just fine.” 
A strange earthquake begins to hit Sour, It is so powerful that buildings are being knocked over then a loud cracking sound happens, strange vines begin to appear on the wall and a door appears on the wall then all of a sudden everything was still
Cancer:*feels a wave of power, appears from inbetween*”What was that?”
Ryker: “What was that?”
Wiziker: “I have no idea.”
Cancer:”aren’t you supposed to be super smart, or have you lost some of your smartness?”
Wiziker: “Smart? Who do you think I am?”
Cancer:”I think that you are Wiziker, an alternate version of ryker”
Wiziker: “Somewhat accurate.”
Cancer:”Okay, then It likely wasn’t ryker then, because you would probably know, right?”
Wiziker: “I doubt it.”
The door opens and Radharc comes out but he looks much younger than he was, he now looks to be in his 90’s
Radharc: “Wow, I feel 100 years younger”
Wiziker: “Ryker may have just spouted a prophecy.”
Cancer:”So we have time travelers now?”
Radharc: “No, I was able to temporarily change my age for 5 days”
Wiziker: “Does no one else care about this!” *gestures toward Ryker*
Cancer:”yeah I do, the old man was just more pressing at the moment. What happened to him anyway?”
Radharc: “We need to have a meeting, that proficy is super important”
Ryker: “Prophecy? About what?”
Cancer:”you seem to have spoken a prophecy about another man that was rather unfortunate, don’t worry though, he won’t come back.”
Hestuia: *invisible* “Good luck with that.”
Cancer:”don’t say that. How about you try to be comforting to ryker.”
Hestuia: “Why? We’re all dead either way.”
Cancer:”well then how about we make the most of it okay? And not freak the smoll child out.”
Ryker: *worried* “Who’s gonna kill us?”
Hestuia: “You.”
Ryker: “WHAT!”
Cancer:*uses sand to find Hestuia and clobber him with a hammer*”you be nice to the small child or I will have to kill you, mmkay? Would you like to have your soul separated from your body?”
Hesutia: “I’m not afraid of you.”
Cancer:”well then I may have to teach you some fear”*grabs throat and shoves against wall and holds Hestuia there*
Hestuia: *easily avoids her powers* “I know what comes in the future. You can’t do anything to stop me.”
Cancer:”Well then I will have to find someone who can, maybe Radharc, or Dream, or maybe Ryker. Would ryker like to get Hestuia to stop?”
Ryker: “Me?”
Cancer:”Is there anyone else named Ryker here?”
Ryker: *Looks at Wiziker* “Yes.”
Cancer:” I don’t think that his name is ‘Ryker’. His name is ‘Wizard’ and ‘Ryker’ smooshed together. Your name is Ryker, so you are the only ryker here”
Wiziker: “My name is in fact Ryker. I just added the Wiz to the beginning to distinguish.”
Cancer:'' I was meaning other ryker, but okay. If you can help trap hestuia then you are helpful”


Wiziker: “Nah, only someone as equally as powerful as him could, like Ryker.”
Ryker: “I’m not that powerful.”
Cancer:”yeah you are. If you are also Ryker, Wiziker, then couldn’t you be powerful enough, or are you a lesser Ryker?”
Wiziker: “No Rykers are quite as powerful as Ryker was for a reason. If they were, there would be many rebellions and trials, so everyone is a ‘lesser Ryker’”
Cancer:”Okay, makes sense. Then we will have to teach small ryker well.”
Radharc: “You guys do not understand! You can not keep exploiting him just because you two are power hungry!” 
Hestuia: “I’m opposed to this plan.”
Cancer:”I don’t think that you are supposed to like it. 
Radharc: “Leave him alone ”
Querith: “ why don't we just kill him?”
Radharc: *Glares at  him and taps cane*
Querith? is trapped in a cell made of a strange material that nothing can seem to damage
Querith: * begins to laugh uncontrollably.*
???: “You fool. You think these walls can hold me? I spent infinite years in the minds of the 2 buffoons you know training until I can finally be set free.”
Radharc: *Laughs* “Trust me, I want to see you try to get out, This is made of one of the few things that can destroy you”
???: *Smiles broadly and the camera feed cuts off.*
*A huge explosion if felt though the facility* 
Radharc: “Nothing can destroy antimatter, Ryker could barely do it when he was at his peak of power, it can contain the most powerful of talismans!!”
Ryker: “I NOT STRONG!”
Radharc: “He is being mean, ”
???:* appears behind ryker* “Boo”
Radharc: “If you do not leave him alone, I will have to call on some help, and trust me, I may not be as powerful as you, but they are much more.”
???: “ That may be true.” but I've got a job to do.”
Ryker: “I not scared.”
Radharc: “A mhuintir na hoíche, tá bhur n-am tagtha, saor sinn anois chun an solas a shábháil”
???: * grabs ryker and disappears with him.*
??? is untraceable.
Radharc: “I must leave to sector 5.”
Sector 5
Radharc: *Walks to the center of the room* “Taispeáin dom an multiverse”
cúig: “Tá”
Radharcs eyes begin to glow, he can see his friends form the different parts of the multiverse
Radharc: “Tá do chabhair ag teastáil uaim, le do thoil tar éis titim na hoíche leis na comharthaí éigeandála”
A popping sound happens and 5 people come out
Radharc: “Caithfimid an buachaill seo a aimsiú. Scaip amach, ní mór dúinn é a fháil, bain úsáid as gach acmhainn atá ag teastáil riamh!”
5 beings: “Sea, ar mhaithe leis an am”
The beings begin to spread out into the multiverse and 1 of them decides to go to parts of the multiverse that very little is known about
Radharc: “Gheobhaidh mé tú , agus nuair a dhéanfaidh mé is mian leis nach bhfuair sé mé!”*Has idea* “I know How I will find you” *Goes to hall of mirrors* “Show me Ailos”
You see an image of Aiolos lying in a medical bed attached to different fluids, with get well soon balloons around.
Radharc: “Show me aiolos, in rykers mind”
Aiolos: *sitting on a chair*
Radharc: “Do you know where ryker is?”
Aiolos: “Nope.”
Radharc: “Can you at least tell me what universe you are in?”
Aiolos: *sips hot chocolate* “Nope.”
Radharc: “Oh, how much control do you have over ryker?”
Aiolos: “None.”
Radharc: “Thanks for your help…”
Aiolos: *nods*
Radharc: “Show me young ryker”
You see a blank image.
Dream: * laughs uncontrollably.* “ man this is GREAT!” * goes to we’re Ryker is. Physically can't. * 
Hestuia: *stops her* “Trust me Dream, let this play out.” 
A note falls from nowhere and lands at hesuies feet.
“You want ryker, COME AND GET HIM, 
Ps. and don't go to mustafar.”
PPs. Hey lorax
Hestuia: “Here.” *gives paper to Dream.* “I honestly don’t care.”
Dream : * takes it.* “ ohhhhhhhh. What's this.”
Hestuia: “How to find Ryker I guess.”
In dreams head.
Ryker: “ scary girl, can you hear me?”
Dream: “ mmmhmmm. Whats up?’’ 
Cancer:*appears and is confused as to why Dream is talking to herself, stays quiet to listen*
Dream: * is also confused on how Cancer heard her reply because she relied mentally.*
Cancer:”how about we don’t talk about this anomaly, ye?”
Dream: “ na i'm going to bring it up all the time.”
Cancer:”okay, well then I will also listen to your mind talk”
Dream: * goes somewhere so Cancer can't.*
Cancer:*follows in inbetween, dream doesn’t know*
 Cancer somehow can't find her no matter where she goes.
Cancer:*searches for mental link of Ryker, detects him somewhere far away but close at the same time*
Dream : * is still nowhere to be found.* 
Cancer:*is frustrated, begins searching for Radharc”
Bob: * mentally* “ check the note you dweebs.”
Dreams Voice: “ I'm busy right now!”
Cancer’s Voice:”really, what notes, lead me to them”
Ryker’s Voice: “I’m in an endless loop. Help.”
Bob: “ No you're not, now finish your eggs.”
Ryker: “no”
Bob: “ You asked for breaded eggs.”
Ryker: “ no you ”
Bob: “ You are a very child.”
Ryker: * nods*
Bob: “see we agree on something”
Crystal hangs up
A couple  minutes later
Ryker: “heeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeelp”
Dream: *attempts to go to ryker and cant*
Ominous voice: “perhaps i can help”
Ominous voice: *can't*
Ominous voice: “i forgot i am not real”
Cancer:”well, your funny and probably schizophrenia”
Ominous voice: “ yes and no. Bob banished me from his mind and now i am just a voice.”
Ominous voice: “ if you want to save your friend you had better read the note.”
A note falls from nowhere and lands at hesuies feet.
“You want ryker, COME AND GET HIM, 
Ps. and don't go to mustafar.”
PPs. Hey lorax
Hestuia: “But why?”
Ominous voice:” because he's mean”
Dream: “ hi Lorax.” 
Hestuia: “Why?”
Dream: “ hey you brought this upon yourself.”
Hestuia: “In what way?”
Dream: “ you know what I mean.” 
Hestuia: “I didn’t. My catchphrase seems to be the same as a random pop culture phenomena from another universe.”
Dream: “ exactly.”
Hestuia: “That’s not my problem.”
Dream: “ mmmhmmm. Right.” 
Hestuia: “Y’know what? I’m gonna attack the next person who calls me ‘The Lorax’”
Dream: * giggles.* “ What if that’s impossible?” 
Hestuia: “You may think you’re safe, but I know everything that could and will happen.”’
Dream: “ Well hit with your best shot Lorax.”
Rae: * teleports there.* “ yello humans…. And Dream.” 
Dream: “ sup.” 
Cancer:*turns into cow*”moo”
Rae: “ soooo im i the only one who's going to go save Ryker?” 
Cancer:*returns to normal*”naw, i'm going with you to save the small chile bean”
Dream ; “ Sorry, my job is to observe, and occasionally mess with stuff.”
Cancer:”well your not very help full then”
Dream: “ I'm helpful….when i want to be.”
Cancer:”well okay then”
Rae: * takes off her backpack and starts ruffleing around in it.* “ Well, let's see what gear I have.” * pulls out a head piece made of wires, it has small orbs on it and there are unrecognizable symbols on a dial. She looks at it with horror and throws it back into her backpack.* 
Cancer:”what is it”
Rae: “ I don't know. All I know is it made me see something I didn't like when I put it on.”
Cancer:”well should we get rid of it or keep it?”
Rae: “I want to figure it out. I can't make any sense of what I saw though.”
Cancer:”can I try it then, see if it works on both of us”
Rae: “no.”
Cancer:”explain”
Rae; “ I think it's different for everyone.”
Cancer:”Okaaay, well then can I see what it does for me?”
Rae: “ no.” 
Cancer:”you are being frustrating. What did you see”
Rae: “ you would have had to see it yourself.”
Dream; * laughs.* “ohhh this will be FUN!”
Hestuia: *clears throat* “If you would Dream, I’d like to talk to you…privately.”
Cancer:”yes chubby tree man”
Dream: “ ok.’’
Cancer:”humph”*voids into inbetween*
Rae: * is alone.* “ ummm ok then.” 
Ominous voice: “technically i never left”
Rae: “ Oh, hello.” 
Ominous voice: “if you need company i am here”
Rae: “ ok. Thanks” * takes head piece out and considers putting it on.*
Dream’s voice: “ oh please do!” 
Hestuia: “You can call me literally anything, just don't call me the Lorax, or bad things could happen.”
Dream: “ elaborate.” 
Hestuia: *clears throat* “As part of my job…I have to make anything about the future sound mysterious and make little to no sense while rhyming….so…” *pauses* “Call me The Lorax, I speak for the trees, just a sort warning, to set your mind at ease. Although my life seems normal, quite possibly even bland, if you tempt me with that name, your life is sure to end.”
Dream: “ ohhhh.”
Rae: “ should I?”
Dream: “ YES!” 
Rae: “ I better not regret this.” * nervously puts on. She falls over. Her eyes are foggy like she’s seeing something else. She suddenly starts screaming as if she’s in pain. She gets to her knees and shakily starts muttering to herself. After a minute she turns around and looks in horror and returns to normal. She takes the head piece and throws it.*
Dream: * giggles.* “ That was FUN!” 
Rae: * looks at her in concern.* 
Hestuia: *clears throat* “Well I didn’t see THAT!”
Dream: “ I thought you could see the future.” 
Hestuia: *chuckles* “I can! All of them.”
Rae: “ What are you talking about? The girl wasn’t me. And she was like ten.” 
Dream: “ 12 actually.” 
Wiziker: *coughs* “So what did I miss?”
Dream: “ Well Rae just watched a vision of a sort that only I understand.” 
Wiziker: “How’d she see the vision?”
Rae: * holds up the head piece.* “ this thing.”
Dream: “ it wasn’t a vision, it was a memory.” 
Rae: “ from who?” 
Dream: * just laughs.* 
Wiziker: “From her obviously.”
Dream: “ nope. Someone else.” 
Wiziker: “Then who?”
Dream: “ watch it yourself. You’ll figure it out… eventually.” 
Wiziker: *looks through headpiece*
He sees a memory of another sorta familiar person which he can’t make out
Dream: “ only Rae can see it through there.” 
Wiziker: *sighs* “Then What do you expect from me?”
Dream: “ read her mind of course.” 
Wiziker: “I’d prefer not to waste my life on that.”
Dream: “ well then you'll never know.” 
Wiziker: *sighs* “All right.”
Hestuia: *slurps smoothie*
Rae: “ uhhh ok? It’s not a pretty memory so be prepared.” 
Wiziker: *looks at her* “Is a month of my life worth it?”
Rae: “ It's not that long.” 
Wiziker: *sighs* “No. Unlike Ryker, every time I use my magic, I lose part of my life.”
Dream: “ I can show you. You could have just asked.”
Wiziker: “I thought I explained well before I said quote, ‘I’d prefer not to waste my life on that.’”
Dream: “ one you choose, two I mean I can project it into your head.” 
Wiziker: *pauses* “All right. Fine. Project it or whatever.”
Dream: * Grins miniacly.* 
He sees an image of a girl with  dirty blond hair and gray blue eyes. She is 12 and laying on the ground of a bathroom. The memory is through her perspective. She feels pain in her head. The girl screams and stands up and begins pacing, muttering things like ‘ your ok.’  A younger girl walks into the entrance of the bathroom “ why are you bleeding?” The blond girl responds with
“ I’m not. Just go get mom.”  The younger sister exits and it’s back to pacing and muttering a woman enters and reels back in horror. The girl turns and looks in the mirror. Blood runs down her head, staining her hair and running down her shoulder. It fades to black
Wiziker: “That…was terrifying.”
Rae: * shakes.* “ yeah.” 
Wiziker: “Who was that?”
Rae: “ I don’t know.”
Wiziker: “I’m pretty sure it’s Dream.”
Dream: “ I have black hair and red eyes. I’ve always been like that. And I’m 10.” 
Wiziker: “Oh duh, it’s Rae.”
Rae: “ yellow eyes. And I don’t remember that.” 
Wiziker: “Rain?”
Rae: “ she’s me.” 
Wiziker: “Well There's only one other girl I know.” *pauses* “But she’s gone..”
Dream: * busts out laughing.* “ You forgot THREE different girl characters.” 
Wiziker: “Well It’s not Cancer. It’s not Lottie Darcy…and it’s not *insane coughing fit*”
Dream: “ you STILL forgot someone.” 
Wiziker: “Who?”
Dream: “ think about it.” 
Wiziker: “Are you referring to the higher beings?”
Dream: “ who?” 
THE Author: “Don’t bring me into this.”
Dream: “ ohhh them. Also maybe.” 
Wiziker: “Is that a yes?”
Dream: “ nope!” 
Wiziker: *shrugs* “There’s like no one else.” *pauses* “Yep…no one…”
The Land Of Higher Beings
Girl: “Is he talking about us?”
Mimick: *shrugs*
Dream: “ yes there is. You just skipped her.” 
Back in the land of the living
Wiziker: “What! I said *intense coughing fit*”
Dream: “ nope! Though this person rarely talks, much less does stuff.” 
Wiziker: “Snitch?”
Dream: “ Snitch is a snitch.” 
Wiziker: *thinks* “There’s literally no one else.”
Dream: “ well you brought them up but….” 
Wiziker: “Lottie Darcy?”
Dream: “ what no.”
Rae: “ What about the authors? One of them is a girl.” 
Wiziker: “Two of them are actually. The other just doesn’t speak often.”
Rae: “ Well there you go. Two options.” 
THE Author: “I’m quite opposed to whatever this is so…”
4th Wall: *screams in pain*
Dream: “ I can’t help that I’m meta.” 
THE Author: “And what’s your goal with this?”
Dream: “ he asked. And I have no goal. That place is off limits anyway.” 
Wiziker: “I don’t get it. Why’d you bring them up?”
Dream: “ you asked. Plus only meta characters understand this.” 
Wiziker: “I do grasp my existence as a plaything for weird 14 year olds.”
Rae: “ WAIT WHAT!”
Dream: “ see what you did. She wasn’t supposed to know.” 
Wiziker: *turns to Rae* “Well what did you think? These author beings are just 14 year olds typing things. I mean what did you think? That we actually exist? And that anything we do actually matters? I’ve seen the author. Unlike the rest of you, who don’t have eyes in the physical plane of existence.”
Dream: * sighs.* “ I’ll fix this.” * runs of to find a dream cater.* 
Wiziker: “No, this is my fault. But before I erase your mind Rae, what do you think about this?”
Rae: “ what? I’m not real? None of this is. It doesn't matter if we save Ryker or he gets the multiversal gems or anything. We’re just play things!” 
Wiziker: *nods* “Welcome to the reality of your sad existence. In fact, you aren’t saying anything right now. You have an illusion of free will. All of us do. There’s no point. Goodbye.” *holds out hand and wipes Rae’s memory of the last couple minutes*
Rae: * stumbles back.* “ wha.. what happened?” 
Wiziker: “Ryker possessed you.”
Rae: “ why?” 
Dream: “ Well that was a waste of time.” * throws dream catcher.* 
Wiziker: *glances at Dream and gives her a look* “I think he’s regaining his memories…”
Rae: “ huuu,”
Cancer:*appears*”u oh”
Rae: ‘’ what?”
Wiziker: “What do we do?”
Cancer:”we could try to stop it, or we could just let it happen, idk”
Wiziker: “Do you want Ryker to happen again?”
Cancer:”yeah that’s not a good idea, so how will we stop him from happening again”
Wiziker: *shrugs* “He’s gone right now so I have no idea.”
Cancer:”well we need to find him, if where he is is causing him to regain him memories, then we need to find him”
Wiziker: “It might just be logical. When people who have amnesia are exposed to things relating to key memories, it sometimes induces them.”
Cancer:”okay, so we need to find ryker. Any ideas?”
Hestuia: *holds up note*
Cancer:*takes note and reads*
It reads “You want ryker, COME AND GET HIM, 
Ps. and don't go to mustafar.”
PPs. Hey lorax
Cancer:”well that isn’t very informative, except for the fact that it isn’t from Hestu”
Hestuia: *shrugs*
Cancer:”well what do you think that it means?”
Wiziker: “That he's not on Mustafar.”
Cancer:”Okay, what other places could he be then?”
Wiziker: “Some other planet from star wars maybe?”
Cancer:”I don't think that that is realistic, but maybe in another dimension?”
Wiziker: *shrugs*
Cancer:”well shouldn't we look?”
Wiziker: “Go right on ahead.”
Cancer:”you seem like you know that he isn’t there”
Wiziker: “Isn’t where? A random location? I’m quite confident about that.”
Cancer:”yeah, but like another dimension. What areas do you think that he would likely be”
Wiziker: *shrugs*
Hestuia: “You do realize he was kidnapped…right?”
Cancer:”yeah, well who kidnapped him”
Hestuia: “Querith.”
Cancer:”well then let's find Querith”*uses link to Querith to try and find him*
Hestuia: “Good luck.”
Cancer:*can’t find him*”Well he’s not in this dimension, nightfall, or in the in between. I can only find links if they are in dimensions that i have visited”
Hestuia: “Well then now what?”
Cancer:” are there other dimensions that we don’t know about Wiziker?”
Wiziker: “There's infinite universes my friend, so…”
Cancer:”No, dimensions, not universes, I can sense in all the universes, but not like, another in between that I haven’t visited. 
Wiziker: *coughs* “Um..there's many dimensions in each universe…”
Cancer:”see, now that works, i can see in the universes, but not their individual dimensions. I don’t think that we can search each of the universes”
Wiziker: “You do grasp that each universe has infinite dimensions.”
Cancer:”well that’s amazing, so I guess that we just have the note, Rae, and Wikier, and maybe Hestu”
Ominous voice: “ you know that he is a trickster so the first place i would look is mustafar.”
Rae: * blinks rapidly* “ Whoa, I think I just zoned out.” 
Dream: “ not much happened. They just tried to find Ryker.” 
Hestuia: “It’s Hestuia.” *pauses* “And let’s go.”
Wiziker: “All right.”
Hestuia: “Follow me.” *he walks forward and fades out of existence*
Wiziker: *follows Hestuia and also fades*
Rae: * follows.*
Mustafar
Hestuia: *waits for Dream*
Dream: * is already there.* “ I beat you!” 
Hestuia: “Congrats.” *pauses* “Now what?”
Rae: “ I dunno.”
Dream: “ I thought you had this all figured out.” 
Hestuia: “Nope.”
Dream: “ Well you guys are screwed.”
The ground begins to shake as ??? pops up on a rockstar stage.
???: * is in a an 80’s outfit* “ whos ready to rock”
Hestuia: “This rock.” *holds up a rock*
???: “ i see you have a sense of humor “
Hesutia: “Indeed I do.”
Cancer:*appears*”wow”*sarcasm*
Dream: “this is going to be fun. And probably a trap.”
Cancer:”yep”
Rae: * prepare for anything.*
Cancer:* prepares as well*
???: “ well let's rock” *metal ozezes ot of his hands to form a guitar studded with crystals.*
Cancer:”aren't you just Querith?”
Rae: * examines room for clues on Ryker.*
???: * strumms the guitar and a sound 10x louder than a jet engine comes out stunning everyone.*
Rae: * flinches but keeps looking.*
???: *  starts playing metallica sending huge waves of sound on them.*
Rae: * creates a force field so she doesn't seem to mind.*
Cancer:*voids to inbetween to block out sound, but still watch*
Dream: * laughs as sound waves pass through her.* “ that tickles.”
Cancer:*in in between, watches dream in concern*
???: “oh we have a heckling crowd” *throws a crystal at dream turning her physical.*
Dream: * vanishes for a moment then returns.* “ You can't force my physical form. You have to find it.” 
Cancer:”well that's interesting”*appears behind speakers and unplugs guitar, vanishes*
???: “okay but I'm going to kill you friends” * the force field shatters as he plays the right frequency.” 
Rae: * just makes a new one.*
Dream: “ I can save them before anything bad happens.”
???: “ yes but you know that the ground has collapsed and they are falling to the lava below right.
Rae: * is floating mid air.*
The ground collapses
Cancer:*still in inbetween watching, doesn’t affect her*
10 ton metal weight falls shattering the force field and knocking rae out and sending her hurtling towards the lava
Rae: * Voids to cancer*
Cancer:*Takes Rae to inbetween*”Are you okay?”
Rae: “ yeah im fine.”
Different ???: “hey y'all”
Cancer:”okay good”*punches different ???”
A loud clang happens and she feels like she punched an oncoming train
Cancer:*armour appears*”your just a ryker anomaly but Querith”*armour disappears*
Rae: “ Hey.” 
Different ???: “nope guess again.”
Cancer:”well… a guessing game is no fun Querith”
Different ???: we are what one would call a strange anomaly. You think Ryker is the only one?”
Cancer:”no, the only noticeable one though”
Different ???: “that was the point we didn't want to be noticed until the right time. You people interfere a lot”
Dream: “ Welcome to my world. Do you know how long I just sat there and watched?!”
Cancer:”we’re not supposed to interfere, you make it mighty hard not to kidnapping ryker and all. I’ve been in and out of the in between a lot, how did you not notice?”
Different ???: “ No, you can interfere all you want, now.”
Cancer:”what makes it okay now?”
Dream : *shrugs.*
Cancer:”okay then”
D?: “Well now we have ryker. All we need him to do is to join the endless one”
Cancer:”well endless one, how is ryker alive then? You better not be torturing him”
Dream: “ THAT'S ALL?! We came here for NOTHING?!”
D?: “ Good, will you let us keep him then?”
Dream: “ Can I still talk to him?”
Rae: “ ummm im not ok with this.”
Cancer:”I don’t think that we can let you keep him”
D?: “who said I was giving you an option.”
Dream: “ you didn’t but id stop them from fighting you if i could still talk to him.”
Cancer:”the threat of another ryker anomaly”
Rae: ‘’ oh no.”
D?: “well yes after he has joined you can talk to him. Right now he just needs training.” 
Dream : * lights on fire. In a warped voice* “ NO! I WANT TO TALK TO HIM NOW!” 
Cancer:”well you're an illusion that is mighty real dream. And no, he doesn’t need training. “*shifts to dragon like human thing and summons sword and armour*
D?: *sighs.* “ battle it is then, I had hoped it wouldn't come to me killing you.”
Rae: * disappears.* 
Cancer:”Well, phycotic people don’t want to kill.”*follows away with rae through mental link*
Cant 
D?: * reluctantly stabs into the void hitting Rea.”
She isn't there
Dream: * follows and lights D? on fire.* 
Cancer:* is confused but keeps following, summon armor*
D?: “ please don't make me do this”
Dream: *still in warped voice.* “  LET ME TALK TO RYKER!!” 
D? “ fine but he has to talk to you, you can't contact him.”
Dream: * calms down a little .* “ ok.” 
Cancer:*returns, shivering*
Dream: * doesn't seem to notice.*
Cancer:*glares at D? Who is now frozen, turns to  Dream*”what happened to rae, she doesn’t seem to exist. I can’t find her with a mental link”
Dream: “ She's not here.”
Cancer:"Well that's weird, it was cold, and nothingness, like not existing, I’m not going to be ready to try that again for a while.”
Dream; * looks mad at the fact that D? Is frozen. She lights on fire again. In warped voice.* “ NOO!!!!” 
Cancer:*agrees in silence*”why are you so mad, we don’t have to deal with him, and can vanish and look for ryker more”
Dream: “ NOOO!! I need….i need to…. I-i.” 
Cancer:*is concerned*”do you need to find ryker, or smoosh D? What do you need to do? I’m really confused”
Dream: * in warped voice.* “ RYKER!!!” 
Cancer:”why are you connected to ryker, are you a part of ryker, or something”
Dream: * does not answer.*
Cancer:”What are you?”
Dream: “ That's not important.”
Cancer:”Okay, well can you use your link or whatever to find ryker?”
Dream: “ I already tried.”
Cancer:”could we link powers and try to find him through our links?”
Dream: “ NO!” * disappears.* 
Cancer:*follows, is cold*
She can feel Dream but not follow her
Cancer:*frustration, screams fire into the air, voids into the real world to find a mirror, shoves hand through mirror, it breaks.*”nothing works in this world”
Dreams Voice: “ nope.”
Cancer:*returns to in between.*”ya think!! This world is broken”*shifts away  into shadesmar, looks for links*
Dream: “ And yet you want to go to reflections.” 
Cancer:*finds a dim ryker mind flame*
Dream: * rushes over and grabbes it.*
Her hand goes through the flame
Cancer:”that’s not how it works. He is in the same place in another dimension, now we have to search through the dimension at this very spot. Dimensions warp, and the same places are different in every realm, so we may shift far away from where he really is.”
Dream: “ we? No me.”
Cancer suddenly seems to pass out. She finds herself tied down in an unfamiliar place. Her sword and armor dont work.
Dream: “ Now stay.” * goes to find Ryker.*
Cancer:*roars fire and puts it on the things tying her down*
Does Not work.
Cancer:*voids away into in between muttering about mind monsters*
Hestuia: *slurps smoothie*
Wiziker: *hiding behind Hestuia*
Cancer:”what are you two scared about and how did you get into the inbetween.”
Wiziker: *slurps smoothie*
Cancer:*takes smoothie and eats it all*
Dream: * uses Cancers strategy to find Ryker. Finds it but can't reach it.* 
Cancer:*gets brain freeze. groans*
D?: “ You guys can't access ???’s dimension.” * slurps his own smoothie *
Hestuia: “If I beat you will you give us access to Ryker?”
Wiziker: “Hey! My smoothie!”
D?: “maybe if you defeat all of us”
Dream: “ YOU PROMISED! LET ME SEE HIM!!” 
Hestuia: “Right then, go ahead.”
Wiziker: “I’ve got your back.”
Hestuia: *nods and whispers various things to Wiziker*
Wiziker: “Really?” *shrugs* “Right then.” *Wiziker slumps on the ground, unconscious*
Hestuia: “Right then…” *Wizikers Voice kicks in, and becomes warped* “Here…we…go!”
Hesziker: “Hit me with your best shot.” *Wizikers body vanishes*
Dream: * looks ready to assist if needed.* 
Hesziker: “I’m fine. Just guard our other Body, would you?”
Dream: * nods .* “ only if you promise to win.” 
Hesziker: *chuckles* “I essentially can’t be beaten in this form.”
Dream: “ good.” 
Hesziker: “Now…Here we go.” *pauses* “What are you? Chicken? Come at me!”
Suddenly….a loud ticking can be heard…again….
Hesziker: “Oh for Petes…”
A ringing occurs And Time is Frozen in “The multiverse”
Aiolos: *wakes up in a hospital bed* 
He’s in a room with multiple tubes connected to him. A Heart Monitor is beating quickly on his right. A variety of “Get Well Soon Balloons are on his left. No one else is in the room
Aiolos: *calls out* “Hello?”
Doctor?: *comes dashing in and calls out to some other people* “He’s awake! Call The Family and friends!”
Aiolos: “What? Where am I?”
Dr. ???: “Do you not recognize me?”
Aiolos: “No…?”
Dr. ???: “It’s me, Gabe!”
Aiolos: “Gabe? But you’ve only just started medical school…”
Gabe: *sighs* “No, that was 12 years ago.”
Aiolos: “12 years!!!!!” *pauses* “But…that would make me…”
Gabe: “34…” *pauses* “Your Birthday was yesterday.”
Aiolos: “34? But…I look and feel the same.”
Gabe: “That’s Because…physically…and This is a medical impossibility…you are. Ever since you went unconscious…”
Aiolos: “But That’s impossible….”
Gabe: *nods* “Aiolos…you’re famous.”
Aiolos: “Famous?” 
Gabe: *nods* “News anchors from around the world have called you ‘The living fountain of Youth’” *pauses* “Scientists have taken blood samples from your DNA, but haven’t found anything.”
Aiolos: “But….”
Gabe: *pauses* “But…? I’ve analyzed your sleep patterns, and found something fascinating! You were in pure REM sleep.”
Aiolos: *clearly overwhelmed* “REM?”
Gabe: “Rapid eye movement. It’s when you have dreams.”
Aiolos: “I did. have a dream…”
Gabe: “Dream? My friend…you had a 13 year long dream.”
Aiolos: “No…it’s closer to about a billion.”
Gabe: “Wait…you remember Your Dream Aiolos?”
Aiolos: *pauses* “It’s Been Quite a Long time since I heard that name…”
Gabe: “What was your dream about?”
Aiolos: “Do you remember what happened the day before I went unconscious?”
Gabe: “You had a dream…yes, I read your little notebook about the ‘Ryker’ and the ‘Dream’ and other odd people.”
Aiolos: *nods* “Oh…wow. Yes…” *pauses* “I…am Ryker.”
Gabe: “That makes no Sense.”
Aiolos: *sighs* “I can’t explain my Life to you.”
Gabe: “Life?”
Aiolos: “This.” *Gestures around* “is like a dream. After 13 years of living in my brain, I think of it as reality. Now please, leave the room.”
Gabe: “Aiolos?”
Aiolos: “Goodbye. Forever.” *He bangs his head on the wall And knocks himself out.”
Gabe: “Aiol….”
Back in the multiverse
Hesziker: “Did…something change…?”
?D: * looks sad. sighs * “The poor man he and the eternal one are in the same situation.”
Hesziker: “FIGHT ME!”
Dream: “ whoa, that got intense.” 
Snape: *suddenly appears* “Huh. This’ll be interesting.”
?D: “ I'll fight you. Lets begin. Your move
Hesziker: “No, you go ahead.”
Cancer:*voids over to watch in in between*
?D: “ alright “ *begins to move so fast Heszikers eyes can't follow.*
Cancer:*unconsciously slows down time for herself to see D?, but it doesn't seem to do much*
Hesiziker: “You do realize I’m blind.”
D?: “ Yes, but  moving this fast will throw off your other senses.”
Hesiziker: “Other senses?” *chuckles* “With our powers combined, it’s impossible for us to be disoriented.”
Dream: * is impressed.* 
Hesiziker: “Well thank you Dream. Now that you understand that anything you do is useless, will you surrender and take me to Ryker?”
Who: * appears.* “ IM BAC- hold up,  where's chicken face?” 
Hesiziker: “He’s dead.”
Dream: * laughs.*
Who: “ dang it! Who am I going to annoy now?!” 
Hesiziker: “You could annoy Ryker.”
Who: * glares.* “ liar.”
Dream: “ heads up!” 
Who: * gets decapitated By D?. Her head grows back because she can’t die.* 
Hesiziker: “So are you gonna fight me? Or are ya a wimp?”
Who: * spawns thousands of crazy Minecraft creations that start attacking D?.* 
D?. * destroys the minecraft creations and entraps Who before turning to face hesziker.*
Hesiziker: *waits* “Go ahead, CHICKEN FACE!”
Who: “ HEY! THAT'S MY LINE!” * breaks free.* 
Cancer:*appears, makes sword a cast iron pan, clobbers D? Voids to inbetween while still unconsciously slowing down time*
Hesiziker: “I know that.”
Who: “ THEN WHY’D YA SAY IT?!” 
Hesiziker: “Because I don’t care about your feelings. The Lorax guy stole my catchphrase.”
Dream: “ yup. Keep telling yourself that.”
Cancer:*appears*”yeah, you seem to care about absolutely nothing but small ryker”
Dream; “ I care about  more but I just don’t show it.”
D? * sighs* “ You guys took too long.”
Ten portals appear and 10 diffrent ??? appear.
???’s: * incapacitate dream*
D?: “you guys talk to much” 
All of the ??? and D? leave
Cancer:”wellp”*voids away to follow dreams mental link and cant*
Hesiziker: *suddenly splits into 40 clones of himself and begins to chase the ??? and D and calls out “Please protect him on the planet!”
Cancer:*returns*”We can’t protect him if we don’t know where he is”
Hesiziker: “He’s fine. He’s got Dream with him.” *suddenly his muscles relax and he returns to Hestuia*
Wiziker: *appears*
Cancer:”that’s creepy”
Wiziker: “Well what else do you expect us to do? We can barely ever do that.”
Cancer:”I don't know. Let's just get the ???’s”
Hestuia: “There’s no point. They’ll just move him again.”
Cancer:”then what do we do”
Hestuia: “All we can really do is wait.”
Wiziker: “Nope. I need Ryker back.”
Hestuia: *shrugs* “Good luck, but there’s no point.”
Wiziker: “Well let’s wait for another clue.” *pauses* “Or…” *he detects the residue of the portals they escaped through, and reopens them* “Right. Let’s head out Cancer.”
Hestuia: “I’ll come too.” *pulls popcorn out of bush* “Lucky that I saw that disappear yesterday.”
Cancer:*follows, documenting the powers* Secret Author: “It’s me, Hestuia.”
Hestuia: “Here we go!” 
Cancer:*sarcastically*”wee”
“THEY ENTER SIGLE “ THE CITY OF DOORS”
Hestuia: *to the tune of city of stars* “CITY of TUNES!” 
Wiziker: “So now what?” *pauses* “Should we go to my house?”
Cancer:”what can we do at your house, aren’t we supposed to be finding ryker and dream?”
Wiziker: *shrugs* “I mean…give me a second…” *he begins sniffing* “Right. This way.”
Cancer:*documents power and follows*”Why were you sniffing like a dog? Aren’t you supposed to be really powerful?”
Wiziker: “Sorta. Most of my power was limited by Ryker, so…I’m kinda stuck using some more round-about methods.” *He begins leading them in a direction*
Cancer:*continues following*”Okay, is there a way to negate previous Ryker’s restrictions, or is it permanent?”
Wiziker: “Well until he regains those abilities, I haven’t found a way as of yet.”
Cancer:”okay”
Ominous voice: “ well you could ask me, I could temporarily unrestrict you. It might help.”
Wiziker: *chuckles* ‘You could try.”
Cancer:”I don’t think that your very trustworthy, ominous voice. You’ve kind of just appeared”
Ominous voice: “ call me xin”
Wiziker: “You’re not Xin.”
Cancer:”Yeah, I didn’t think that Xin could do anything except for make metal. Your a mimic type being aren’t you”
Xin: “ nope BOB cast me and the rest of us out of his mind.”
Wiziker: “So go ahead and try. It won’t work.”
Cancer:”why are you trying to help? I feel like you have an ulterior motive.”
Xin:: “multiple reasons. 1 I have had to live in this repeating cycle for all of eternity. 2 I want you guys to use the splitter ray to give me a physical body
Wiziker: *continues until he reaches a door* “Through here.”
Cancer:*follows Wiziker through door*”Are you sure that this is the door?”
Wiziker: “Nope.”
Xin: “ you’ll never find him without me”
Cancer:”I really don’t like this”
Xin: “ Too bad, give me a couple hrs to break through some of the limitations. I can't do all of them.”
Cancer:*sighs, continues through door*
Dream: * appears. Stops for a moment.* “ well? Are you coming?” 
Wiziker: “Dream!? Is Ryker safe!”
Dream: “ yeah he’s fine.” 
Wiziker: “What do you mean by coming?”
Dream: “ I wasn’t talking to you.” 
Wiziker: “Who were you talking to?”
Dream: * ignores him.* “ Just touch the rock.” 
 Ryker appears. 
Ryker: “Hello?”
Wiziker: “Ryker! You’re with Dream!?”
Ryker: *nods* “Hey Dream! Can you bring them here?”
Dream: “ no.”
Ryker: “Why not?”
Dream: “ I don’t want them here. This is a special thing for you only.” 
Ryker: “Fine.” *looks at Wiziker* “I’m alright. Don’t worry about me. I’m on a quest.”
Dream: “ I’m surprised Bob didn’t stop us from leaving. But then again we’re still kidnapped. I can’t go anywhere but back.” 
Ryker: *shrugs* “I don’t know. Do any of you have any ideas about inducing memories.”
Hestuia: *shrugs* “You could try brain surgery. Or trying to trigger something from then.”
Dream: “ I don’t technically have a mind.” 
Hestuia: “Oh. We’re talking about you. Right. All you have to do is…I mean…you’re connected to Ryker, right.”
Dream: * doesn't say anything.*
Hestuia: “Right. So if you help Ryker gain his memories, you could possibly have your own return.”
Dream: “ I don’t think it works like that.” 
Hestuia: “You’re right. Sorry, my brain is dealing with multiple different timelines right now.”
Wiziker: “I bet that if you possess Ryker, and obtain a physical brain, then you could have those memories unlocked.”
Dream: * shakes head.* “ I have a brain. I just don’t have a mind.” 
Wiziker: “Hmm. What about shock therapy.”
Dream: “ couldn’t feel it.” 
Wiziker: “I don’t know. Sorry.”
Hestuia: “If i simply told you, it wouldn’t turn out as you hoped. Sorry.”
Dream: “ alright.” 
Ryker: “Do something else. I’ll be fine.”
Dream: “ I can watch him.” 
Ryker: “I don’t need to be watch..” *Ryker vanishes*
Dream: “ See ya.” * disappears.” 
Wiziker: “So. I say we have a goal. Figure out how to restore Dream’s memory, while they try to escape. We should get a think tank.” *pauses* “Summon the think tank! I need Rae, Cancer, Radharc, etc.”
Hestuia: *nods*
Xin: “Things are moving faster than they should be. We must stop him before he ruins the prophecy”
Cancer:”I know.”*documents Ryker’s vanishingness power*”Let's get the thinking tank. And find Rae”
Suddenly in the corner of the room a Tv screen flashes showing images of people all in a coma. This was the real world as it showed Aiolos as well as dream, rea, The ‘Oconners, joseph, and others   then this message followed.
“It's been 13 years since several individuals throughout the world have all been displaying supernatural effects. These people all have unusual features ranging from simply not aging to having themselves and the area around them warped. They remain in a comatose state but lately they have been stirring with reports of them even waking up only to force themselves back to sleep all of them saying something along the lines of “not yet” the current people are not all documented but seem to these powers are and to what extent the have them we are not sure. The current people with these anomalous effects are as follows. Aiolos Hill in New york. He, who had not awoken for 13 years until 2 weeks ago, in which he woke up, and promptly knocked himself back out. Since then many people with a wide range of random effects happening around him at seemingly random times. Aiolos has also summoned random children’s objects including a rubber ducky and a wizard Lego character. He also seems to be reverting to a child-like form. Many of the effects that are now to be listed from the others have been seen in Aiolos. Rae filia, chicago she has been known to randomly summon monsters creatures out of the blue that all say they are there to protect the master for when she wakes up. Evelen ( dream ) hypnosis, Sydney australia has been known to simply be untouchable at all time as well as have random fire spouts occur near her. Brian ( hestuia ) Stone, gravity fall’s oregon  Is known to randomly spout prophecies in his sleep all of them according exactly as he claims. Radharc riddle, cedar city has simply created amazing creations of technology out of nowhere. Jeff O'connor and his uncle Dia O'connor, scotland. They seem to be working in tandem with each other in power temporarily prowess their capabilities are unknown. Joseph Greenpath, anchorage Alaska has had strange plants grow out of nothing as well as had half of his body erased during event 203 And healed in 30 seconds. Cancer Schlupp in Hamburg, Germany. She has taken many forms since entering a coma, most commonly a cat. A suit of armor that seems to appear as well as a sword at random. Recently, she has been fading in and out of seemingly reality, being not there, and then there, with the occasional flame. Eugene (Smile) Martin has woken up on occasion, and is muttering many eerie things about the people who have been forced into this coma. These altered names are found through muttering of his. He was the earliest to be put into a coma. Jake Radic in Dublin Ireland, The room around him has shifted constantly, and recently he split into 3 beings then 2 of the copies disappeared, local authorities have decided it is not safe to get near the area and have evacuated the block around him, Xin Workman, temporarily in india. The most deformed and strange of the bunch, the left side of his body is a metal that appears to be impenetrable; the right side is encrusted with strange crystals that appear to have anomalous effects if used properly. Any fire, water, earth or other basic elements seem to be manipulated by him subconsciously. Xin has a bodyguard of a redwood tree that seems to have gained sentience. He is “ the ambassador of my master“.The gatekeeper, he calls him. The tree says that the time is coming soon that all of the “heroes of old” will awake and then he has no idea. Any attempts to move anyone in the coma have failed for various reasons. Some obvious like having a guard or simply not being able to touch someone to having their arm chopped off by a manic hillbilly ( this was the case with Brian) Others are also being put into this Coma-like state by the day. Though one thing is for sure the counties in custody of the ones who are not there won't let them go ( dream, Xin ,  and the O'connors) fears that the countries in question will weaponize these individuals slowly being conformed as the countries are petitioning for citizenship. But the main news is that next month all of them will be transported to India to see if bringing all of them there will start the gatekeeper’s “birth event that” will wake them up supposedly. This is reporter shandra hamenis ” 
Wiziker: “Lego Character? But I’m human.”
Hestuia: “What!”
Cancer:”why the fire? And a cat. I’m not a cat.”
Hestuia: “I knew we would…but now? It’s too early…”
Cancer:”we would what?”
Hestuia: *muttering in concern* “If Ryker gets to the real world…”
Cancer:”so if that's ‘the real world’ then what is here?”+
Hestuia: “I’m afraid this is all Aiolos’s fault.”
Rae: * teleports there. she looks tired.* “ what the heck just happened!”
Cancer:”what did aiolos do ?”
Hestuia: “It’s not his fault.”
Radharc: “Oh no,I thought I sealed the gap”
Hestuia: *laughs* “You Did. Aiolos just woke up again.”
Cancer:”well the world as we know it is ending. This is amazing.”*sarcasm*
Radharc:”They have not found every one yet. Some of us are still safe… for now”
Rae: “ So what do we do?”
Hestuia: “Wait. Hope. If you get brought to the real world, knock yourself out again ASAP.”
Cancer:”what happens if we don’t”
Radharc: “I can not go back!”
Hestuia: “Once there, a majority of our powers will be useless. If we cannot knock ourselves out within around a day, you’ll just have to wait for Ryker.”
Cancer:”lovely”
Rae: *nods.*
Radharc: “If you get stuck, you must remain calm, try and make your way Dublin Ireland, when you get there go to 20 linenhall Parade”
Xin: “ you guys do realize we have approximately 30 days left until we are all brought to the same place which will wake us up anyway”
Cancer:”yeah… I don’t want to wake up. This is a nice dream”
Rae: “ well maybe it won't be so bad.”
Radharc: “This is not a dream, it is another reality”
Xin: “ no this is definitely a dreaaaaaaaaaaaa…”
Xin wakes up. And immediately creates a hammer and smacks himself in the head knocking him back out
Radharc: “No, no, no, no, It has started.”
Xin: “ these are getting more frequent.”
Radharc: “You do not understand last time I was there, I was…”
Cancer:”you were what…”
Rae: *wakes up.*
Monsters: * cheer.* 
Rae: * though it pains her makes a force field and hits herself in the head with it so she gets knocked out.*
Monsters: “ Awww :,(.”
Radharc: “The first time I was there, I came there willingly, but I was in a…”*Sighs* “I was in elementary school.  If I go back, I will not know what happened, the school was destroyed, I will age back, but, I will keep all of my memories.”
Cancer:”small children are annoying” 
Xin: “ no you wont. The tv only said there was Jake so you will become a part of him.”
Radharc: “The problem is, I can see on and off through him. I can also speak to him in his head, when he is not completely ignoring me.e.e.e.e.e.e.e.e” *almost wakes up but he does not*
Xin: “yes through him but not take any action’s,”
Hestuia: *chuckles* “I was watching the Lorax.”
Radharc: “How, aren't you blind?”
Cancer:”yeahhhhh… how? Plus, don’t you find that insulting?”
Xin: “1 day has passed since the countdown”
Cancer:”how does time work between here and there?”
Xin: “you know how night seems to pass really fast outside your dream while you are sleeping. Yea it's like that.”
Hestuia: “Caught me! Also, just like a Dream State, time is quite variable. It’s pretty slow in this case. And each person begins at a different point in time. I was there for the *shakes* derpocolypse.”
Cancer:”what was that…, do I even want to know?”
Xin: “ no you dont”
Hestuia: *shakes* “You really don’t. I also watched Ryker get his heart broken.”
Cancer:”that’s sad”
Xin: “Well we now have 1 hr until we all wake up” 
Cancer:”Well, that's quite the unsteady countdown.
Xin: “have dreams ever had a normal countdown?”
Hestuia: “Fair point. This is one of the first universes where this happens.”
Cancer:”what should we do when we wake up”
Xin: “ Well Bob will be destroyed and I will be the only personality. But we will be superhuman in a normal world as well as we will have to try not to destroy the country we are in because civilians. So no more super destructive moves we have to not cause property destruction unless we want to be sued,”
Wiziker: “Will this world be destroyed?”
Xin: “ no ryker will regain his memories and this world will be preserved.”
Wiziker: “Will He?”
Cancer:”so this will become another universe, or will stay one anyways”
Radharc: “Time will become strange if all of us leave. ”
Xin: “no every time we sleep we will enter this world”
Cancer:”so there is no more rest, is there?”
Xin: “no I'm afraid not.”
Wiziker: “Ryker won’t regain his memories.”
Xin: “ Oh good.”
Cancer:”what do you mean by that, he won’t regain his previous memoriesssssssssss……?”*wakes up*
Radharc: “He will nee-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d” *Radharc Wakes up into*
Xin: “ times up”*wakes up*
They all wake up in a hut in India as their eyes open, a shout of surprise echoes throughout the room the major leader and generals of all the major countries gasp in surprise as even Aiolos wakes up. Gabe is there as well looking heartbroken. Young man, he says, you’ve got a lot of explaining to do.
Hestuia: “Welcome to the real world.” *You realize that Hestuia is among the world leaders*
Rae: “ this feels…. weird.”
Xin: “ oh, this is underwhelming”
Ryker(Aiolos): “Where’s Wiziker?”
Dream: “ i don't know but, i don't really care right now
Cancer:”yeah, where is he?”
Xin: ”check your pocket.”
Ryker: “You don’t think I did?”
Cancer:”did what.”
Xin: “ Then one of these fools stole wiziker and they're going to pay.”* stands up out of the cot he's spent the longest time in.”
Cancer:*stands up as well, summons armor and swords, starts burning*”what did yall do with wiziker”
Rae: * preps for battle.* “ Give us back the Lego man!”
Jake(Radharc): *Barely breathing* “I need to go back! If I do not go back…”
Xin: * body becomes a unknown metal alloy* “ Where is the lego man?”
Cancer:*walks over to the general, making self taller to be intimidating.*”give us the lego man”*threatens with sword*
Xin: * rips a crystal out of his face.* “ I will use this.”
Rae: * grabbes a knife out of nowhere.*
Jake(Radharc): “Do not worry, I can deal with this, I am much less affected by the power wall here.” *Grabs his cain next to his bed and taps it and nothing happens* “THIS IS NOT MY CANE!” *Walks over to Gabe* “WHERE IS MY CANE! I NEED IT!” *Coughs* “Xin, can you make me a new cane? It needs to be made of darkened demonic alloy, It also needs a core made of darkness”
Xin: “certainly” *the metal on his arm darkens until it looks like the void of space. He throws his hand out and it forms a cane with a lion head peace.*
Radharc: “Thanks, this will do for now” *Taps the cain and the room around them changes to a nice marble floor room* “Much better”
Rae: “ why?”
The world's leaders are confused, they should be thanking us. Instead of threatening us for a piece of plastic.
Radharc: “Now, first of all, you know me as Jake, but you may call me Radharc.”
Cancer:”I am Cancer”
Rae: “ i don't want to say my name.”
The leader of india we have confiscated it until you pledge yourself to india
Radharc: *Taps cane and they are all stuck to their chairs* “No, ireland is my home for ever *taps cane again and the lego man appears in his hand.*
Cancer:*shifts to have wings*”I have no home.”
Rae: * snaps chain in hands.*
Xin: “ laughs you think petty threats can stop us”
Jake(Radharc): “No, we can not let this world know of our existence, as of this moment, We must…”*No*
Radharc: “We are awake now, what do you want us for.”
Cancer:”do not submit to the lowlings.”
Hestuia: “It’s quite simple actually. We want to use you.”
Cancer:”i think that that was apparent from the beginning”*begins to document all of the powers within the room*
Xin: “ for what”
Hestuia: “Well, to protect our countries. You’re superheroes. Or…supervillains.” *looks at Ryker*
Cancer:”why have you made this a superhero and villain story”
Hestuia: “Because That’s what it is. You interlopers are going to destroy the world.” *pauses* “I saw it. Thanks to Aiolos kidnapping me from my friends and family.”
Xin: “what's in it for us.”
Radharc: “As long as I can stay in Ireland, then okay.”
Hestuia: “Not dying.”
Xin: “how do you plan to kill us?”
Radharc: “I have one problem, there are 5 others that work with me”
Hestuia: “The Chips I put in your brain.”
Xin: “ you never had access to my brain.”
Hestuia: “Of course I did.”
Hestuia: “Plus, I built them to counteract all of your powers, except for you Aiolos, yours is much worse. I just deafened you so you can’t hear the buzzing.”
Radharc: “I am happy to help you, as long as I can return to nightfall once per month.”
Xin: “ So we're superheroes not out of choice. Doesn't defeat the point of a hero.”
Hestuia: *chuckles* “Good luck with that.”
Radharc: “ I do not think you understand, I am not the only…” *Begins to shake and his eyes change to the color of Jokes*
Hestuia: “Oh I do.”
Ryker: “Right time to conquer this world.” *pauses* “Why!”
Jake(Joke): “Wow, this place is strange, wait, I am back!” *Shakes and colors change to black*
Ryker: “Great, give me a second, I have to just get rid of the young me.” *pauses* “He won’t leave!”
Jake(The Dark One) “AGHHH, THE LIGHT” *Shakes again and is back to radharc*
Jake(Radharc): “Sorry about that, like I was saying, since you will not let me let me leave.”
Ryker: “Right then. I’ve shut up the midget for now. Great. Now, nerds, surrender or die.”
Hestuia: *surrenders*
Ryker: “And the rest of you stuck ups?”
World Leaders: *nope*
Ryker: “So you have chosen…death.” *snaps them out of existence*
Radharc: “NO”*Taps cane a strange gas begins to fill the room all of the people are sent back to the multiverse, it fails*
Ryker: *teleports away* “Thanks suckers!” *hacks into every single network on the planet*
Radharc: “Really!”
Ryker: *broadcasting* “Hello inferior life forms! I’m Ryker, your new ruler. As you can see, all of your puny world leaders are dead.”
Radharc: “To ireland” *Begins to walk to ireland.* 
Ryker: “If you do not accept my rule, you will die. I can see everything here. Please surrender. I don’t want to kill you again.” *pauses* “Oh crap.” *switches to young Ryker*
Ryker: *faints immediately, shutting off all connections*
Wiziker: *suddenly reforms from the Lego* “That’s better. New world?”
Radharc: “Almost there” *Is in France*
Ryker: *wakes up again* “Not him again.”
Wiziker: “Crap. It’s the weakling.”
Ryker: *switches back, laughs* “Sorry I’m back.”
Radharc: “Welp, just 500 more miles”*Is in UK* 
Ryker: “Right. Time to fix this world.” *pulls all of the continents together to shape his face and pauses* “It’s stupid how slow I am here. I’ll just tear a hole into the multiverse. Or the dream realm or whatever.” *takes a pair of scissors and rips opens a hole into the multiverse above the planet, leaking A1 into the universe* “Yeah. I think this works.” *chuckles* “Hey! It’s the break in the sky!” 
In Rykers head
Young Ryker: “Give me the controls!!!”
Evil Ryker: “No.”
Lazy Ryker: “Why not.”
Hero Ryker: “I’ve got this.” *annihilates everyone in his head except for Young Ryker* “Good luck kid. Hope you turn out better than us!” *kills himself*
Back in ‘The real World’
Ryker: “But…No! I…Need all of you. I need all of you!”
Visions of all the Rykers surround him
Hero Ryker: “Goodbye. Good luck.”
Lazy Ryker: “So long, lucky duck!”
Hyper Ryker: “I don’t know what to say!”
Evil Ryker: “Don’t get in my way!”
Multiversal Gem: “Don’t worry I’ll be back someday!”
Meta Ryker: “Stuff is yet to come!”
Bob: “So stay tuned and have some fun!”
Rykers: “Good luck to me!”
Calm Ryker: “Look forward What do you see!”
Lazy Ryker: “It’s me!”
Hyper Ryker: “It’s me!”
Evil Ryker: “It’s me!”
Secret Ryker: “I don’t know what to say!”
Time Ryker: “Don’t get in his way!”
All Rykers: “We’ll be back….Someday!!!!!!!!!” *they vanish, leaving Ryker*
Hero Ryker: “Or choose a different path, but y'know, I’m biased.” *disappears*
Radharc:”FINALLY IRELAND I’M BACK” *Walks to ryker* “You okay?”
Ryker: *mutters* “What do you think genius?”
Radharc: “Interpreting vague answer as not good”
Ryker: “I’ve got many different paths I’m supposed to take, I’ve got all this responsibility, nothing I do is good enough. I’ve got pressure without relief. The whole multiverse is watching what I do. Me. Who’s just a kid. I can’t do anything.”
Radharc: “Well, I want you to know this, I think you should choose your path, If it is the wrong one then, well, we will just be back here again”
Ryker: *chuckles* “But I can’t, can I? Any path I take, someone will hate me for it.”
Radharc: “Trust me, in life there is always someone that will dislike you, heck, tons of people do not like me.”
Ryker: *chuckles* “Yeah, but you don’t have any pressure. You want me to choose any path, Wiziker wants me to be some sort of almighty being, Dream just wants me to be happy, I don’t know how I’m supposed to be happy.”
Radharc: “What do you want, just ignore what everyone is telling you, what do you want your  life to be.”
Ryker: “I …DON’T ….KNOW!”
Radharc: “That’s okay, you do not have to decide now.”
Ryker: “But It’s not. Think about it. All sorts of immortal beings want me to be something I’m not. They want to choose what happens to me.”
Radharc: “I am sorry you were put into this situation, I will do what you would like me to do.”
Ryker: “You’re just sympathizing to get on my side so you can use me.”
Radharc: “Trust me, I do not want to use you, heck, I do not think I will be around for much longer any ways.”
Ryker: *chuckles* “Trust? I can’t trust anyone. You, Dream, Hestuia, Wiziker, even myself.”
Radharc: “Then don’t.”
Ryker: “Well then what can I do?”
Radharc: “What is one thing you have always wanted to do?”
Ryker: “Nothing. I’ve never been allowed to have an opinion of my own. Everything’s either been to help or hurt someone else.”
Radharc: “Then why don’t you just try to relax, think about what you want to do with your life.”
Ryker: “See! You want me to relax! You're telling me to do something!”
Radharc: “No, you can do whatever you want, I am here to do anything you want me to do.”
Ryker: “Can I? So I can just kill everyone on this planet.”
Radharc: “I mean, if you do, I can't promise that I will not bring everyone back, but you do you.”
Ryker: “I rest my case.”
Present Author: “Wow, quite an issue for him!”
THE Author: “Oh shut up. He’s having a moment.”
Future Author: “Is Fourth Wall dead or?”
Radharc: “What would you like me to do?”
Ryker: *sighs* “Leave me alone. I know what I want to do. Maybe.”
Radharc: “Okay, if you need me, you know where to find me”*Radharc Leaves the room*
Ryker: “Now back to my goal.” *sighs and starts to walk toward Gravity Falls*
Jake begins to have a mental break
The Dark One: “I have a plan, We will go into the dark forest and sulk for some time”
Radharc: “NO, I am not sitting in the middle of nowhere for 50 years again!”
Scientist: “I’m back, FINALLY”
Radharc: “All in favor of blocking off scientist”
All beside Scientist: “YES”
Space Core:”SPACEEEEEEEEEE”
Radharc: “First, we need to bring sector 5 to ireland, will… we are going back”


Back out of the brain
Ryker: *detaches everyone’s connections to their physical form, returning them to normal, in the same locations as before* “Dream?” 
Dream: “ I'm here.” 
Radharc: “Well that was interesting” 
Hyperlink to when Ryker was kidnapped.
Rae: “ Soooooo can we agree to never do that again.”
Ryker: “Yep.”
Dream: “ I literally couldn’t care less.” 
Rae: “ I’ll be back.” * goes into her backpack to have a conversation with Lottie Darcy.* 
Ryker: “So Dream…follow me. We’re going to get a memory gun from a tv show that erases memories, and then re-engineer it to remember memories.”
Dream: “ why? I don’t think that would help.” 
Ryker: “Why wouldn’t it?”
Dream: “ It's not your problem.” 
Ryker: “But it is. It’s what I want to do. Cause I’m curious.”
Xin: “  If you do it you will be doing both dream and wizikers versions of you. You will be having fun like dream says and you will be answering a curious urge and curiosity is the road to discovery which leads to progress which is essential to a good leader. Erm also i'm curious.”
Cancer:”yeah, be rather interesting to know where dream came from.”
Dream: “ what if I don’t want you guys to know.”
Rae: “ hiding from your past isn’t going to help. Take it from me.”
Ryker: *clears throat* “Yeah…hiding your past is bad.” *pauses* “Anyways…letsgoseeyoubye!” *opens a portal and teleports them both away*
Dream: “ ummm ok?” 
Ryker: “What?”
Dream: “ Well I guess this is happening whether I like it or not.” 
Ryker: “The whole reason I’m doing this is to meet your ‘friends’ if you have a simpler way, great!”
Dream: “ nope. But I don’t think it will work.” 
Ryker: “Might as well try.”
Dream: “ I mean I don’t have a mind soooooo.”
Ryker: “Well is there no way to contact them?”
Dream: “ I dunno. I don’t even know what or who they are.” 
Ryker: “How do they send you info?”
Dream: “ mentally.” 
Ryker: “Right. Is there anything you know about them that you can tell me?”
Dream: “ they hurt.” 
Ryker: “Do you mind if I come back to your home to look around if you missed something.”
Dream: “ reflections? Sure.” 
Ryker: “Right then.” *goes to reflections inconspicuously*
Dream: * opens a portal.* “ Now come on.”
Ryker: *goes through portal*
Dream: * shuts it before anyone else can come through.* “ go crazy.” 
Ryker: “So. I say we look for things. Where should I look first?”
Dream; “ you do realize that the items that appear here are all just random objects right. We could search for hours and find nothing important, or be searching for five minutes and just happen to find a jackpot.”
Ryker: “Well let’s do it then.” *starts rooting through random objects*
He finds nothing relating to what he wants.
Ryker: “Come on! Any ideas?”
Dream: * shrugs.* “ All you can do is keep looking until you find something. By the way objects fly out of reflections ALL the time so watch your head.”
Right as she says that a random item lifts up on its own and hurdles itself out of reflections.
Cancer:*Outside of reflections, ducks under chair that came flying out of a mirror on the wall, documents how the chair came out. grumbles*”I really need to find out how to get in there without Dream”
Dream; “ that my friend, is impossible.” 
Cancer:”I don’t think so. I will find out how”*documents dreams power further to learn how to use it*
There's no powers to document.her powers cant be copied. At least the ones Cancer wants.
Cancer:”there is no such thing as impossible”
Dream: “ well it is, but you'll still need my help to do it. And you have to come to reflections first.”* disappears.*
Cancer:”I will hunt you down and get you Dream.”
Dreams Voice; “ good luck!”
Dream: “ so short stuff. What are we doing first?”
Ryker: *shrugs* “I guess we just keep digging through the rubble.”
Dream; “ ok.”
They search for one hour straight. And find nothing.
Dream: “ Do you want to keep looking? You look tired.”
Ryker: “Yes.”
Cancer:*inside the in between, learns how to view into reflections, watches them*
Cancer can’t watch without Dreams permission but she gives it because yes.
Xin: * begins to ooze metal out into a flawless statue of himself.”
Ryker: *Busy rooting through utter garbage*
He sees a beat up tape with the words D.R.E.A.M written on it
Ryker: *snatches it* “Yes!”
Dream: “ what is it?”
Ryker: “It’s tape. With your name on it as an acronym.”
Dream: “ Well then how do you know it’s my name?” 
Ryker: “What Else could it be?”
Dream: “ I don’t know, but my name isn’t an acronym. It’s just Dream.” 
Ryker: “Are you sure?”
Dream: “ ……yes?” 
Ryker: “That didn’t sound like you were sure.” *pauses* “Now I can’t say for sure. But I think you’re some kind of robot.”
Dream: “ I know for a fact I’m not a robot.”
Ryker: “How?”
Dream: “ I can create fire. I can think like a normal human. I function like a normal human. I can eat, sleep, feel cold and get sick.  I’m sorta human.” 
Ryker: “Right. I get it. So then what is this?” *holds the tape*
Dream: “ it’s a tape. With D.R.E.A.M on it.” 
Ryker: “Well let’s hear what it has to say.” *eats tape, and it begins playing* “Don’t ask.”
 The tape is a video tape. It can’t play inside of Ryker
Ryker: *coughs it back out* “Dang it. It’s a video tape. Let’s see…we could try a VCR, but I don’t know where we’d get one.”
Dream: “ you do realize you can just teleport one here. Or I could find one.” 
Ryker: “Fair point.” *focuses on tape and summons a VCR player* “Right. Here we go.” *pushes the thingy into the thing*
On screen the tape shows an image of a lab. There is a white chamber with something inside. It seems to be at an odd Angle. Like from one of those cameras hidden in glasses. There are two people at a desk in front of the chamber. One is a boy and the other is a girl. There is a man standing in between them. Their backs are turned to the camera. 
Man: “ Is it ready yet?”
Woman: “ almost sir. We’re still working out a few bugs but it should be ready for testing soon.”
Man: “ good. Now let me talk to our volunteer.”
The camera moves closer to the chamber. There is a girl inside. She has spiky black hair and green eyes. She is wearing a white dress. She is sitting inside a circle of salt. Inside the circle with her is an unidentifiable black and red thing. It seems to be trying to escape.
Man: * pushes a button. Talking into a microphone.* “ Evelin? Evelin, can you hear me?” 
The girl jerks her head up and towards a spot on the wall chamber where an intercom system is hanging. She nods. She doesn't seem to see the people outside the chamber
Man: “ good. Now we’re just going to do a little experiment, ok? You like experiments don't you?”
The girl nods.
Man: “ Well it’s going to pinch a little but you can take it. Now can you be a good girl and sit nice and still for me?”
The girl nods again.
Man: “ good.” * he releases the button. To the boy.* “ Are we ready?” 
Boy: “ It might be a little rocky but we can start it now.”
Man: * nods.* 
Woman: * types something into her computer.* “ we’re on in three, two, one.”
A strange high pitched noise seems to start in the chamber. The girl, Evelin screams in pain and covers her ears. The black and red thing starts shrieking. They both seem to start to glitch. A force moves them together. They seem to glitch together then the black thing is gone. The noise stops and Evelin falls to the ground, unconscious. 
Boy: “ Oh my goodness! Did we just kill her?!” 
Man: “ She's fine. Her body is just getting used to the change.” 
The girl wakes up. Her eyes are black now with red dots for pupils. Sharp teeth are barely visible. She seems angry, and in pain and confused. She looks around and seems to see something. She grabs for it but some invisible force stops her. She places her hands above where the salt is and it is like she is touching a barrier.
Woman: “ it seems to have worked. She’s trapped by the salt.”
Boy: “ what happened to her eyes?” 
Man: “ It's just another side effect.”
The girl bangs on the barrier and screams trying to escape. In rage she somehow lights herself on fire. Eventually the fire dies away and she grasps her chest. When she pulls away it is seen that red is visible through the dress. Near her neck and shoulders crack shaped cuts are seen. The people at the desk freak out.
Man: * turns to the camera. His face is fuzzy and unrecognizable. To the camera.* “ Don’t just stand there! Get in there and help her! We can’t let her die!” 
The camera seems to move towards the chamber and the video ends.
Ryker: “Well then. You’ve got an evil shadow monster in you.” *pauses* “Do you remember anything else?”
Dream: “ demon, not shadow monster. Yes I do remember that.” 
Ryker: “Who’s the camera person?”
Dream: “ I don’t know.”
Ryker: “Do you remember anything else about them?”
Dream: “ no. I didn’t even see them.” 
Ryker: “So what did you see?”
Dream: “ wight.”
Ryker: “If you wanted to…I could find them.”
Dream: “ no.”
Ryker: “Why not?”
Dream: “ No.” 
Ryker: “Hmph. You can’t stop me. I’m gonna find them.” *snatches tape out of VCR*
Can’t find them. 
Ryker: *chuckles* “Oh I’ll find them.” *suddenly he vanishes into the tape*
Ryker finds himself in an imaginary world. He is in the chamber with Evelin. There people behind the window are gone
Ryker: *appears in the chamber with Evelin.* “ hey.” 
Evelin: * she looks up at him. Her voice has a British accent.* “ hello. Are you a volunteer too?” 
Ryker: “Nope.”
Evelin: “ Then why are you here?”  
Ryker: “To save you, duh.” *licks finger and breaks ring of salt.*
Evelin: “ the people said that was important.” 
Ryker: “You mean the people who are about to torture you by putting a demon inside you?”
Evelin: “ they wouldn’t do that.” 
Ryker: “They wouldn’t? Why not?”
Evelin: “ They're good. They're going to do good things.” 
Ryker: “Do you know them?”
Evelin: * nods.* 
Ryker: “What are their names?”
Evelin: “ can’t tell.” 
Ryker: “Why not?”
Evelin: “ I promised I wouldn’t. And I trust them a lot more than I trust you. You're not even supposed to be here.” 
Ryker: “Oh yeah? Watch this.” *pulls a clone of the tape out of his pocket, summons a VCR, and plays it in front of her, at 4 times speed*
Evelin: “ What was the point of that? It was just a bunch of static.” 
Ryker: “Great. Um. But did you see me summon the VCR?”
Evelin: “ yeah? So? He told me about people with gifts.” 
Ryker: “Gifts.” *chuckles* “Oh honey. I’m much more than a man with a gift.” *he begins to show off various different powers, getting slightly lightheaded and winded*
Evelin: “ Man? You're just a boy.” 
Ryker: *pants* “You’d think that, but…not really. I’m about 2 millennia old.” *pants* “I need you…to tell me…everything you know about them…” *pants* “It’s important.”
Evelin: * turns her back to him.* “ no.” 
Ryker: “You stubborn…!” *pause and clams down* “Why not?”
Evelin: “ I don’t trust you.” 
Ryker: *sighs* “I get it. It’s just…I’m trying to do something important for once.”
Evelin: “ Then why stop this. This is important.” 
Ryker: “It isn’t important, it’s deadly. I’ve seen it. I can see the future.”
Evelin: “ what? Am I going to die?” 
Ryker: “No…but you’ll get very, VERY close. And you’ll never be the same.”
Evelin: “ I’m not supposed to be the same. I’m supposed to be new.” 
Ryker: “What’s the goal of the experiment? Do you know?”
Evelin: “ yes. But I can’t tell you.” 
Ryker: “It's not gonna turn out like it was planned.”
Evelin: “ Of course it is. His friend. He told me so. And he can… oh biscuits.” 
Ryker: “You understand now?”
Evelin: “ oh no. I wasn’t supposed to tell you that.” 
Ryker: “The teenager with the lemon blond hair and lab coat?”
Evelin: “ who?” 
Ryker: “Never mind.” 
Evelin: “ Now I’m sorry to do this. I know it’s rude but I’m going to start ignoring you now. And wait.” 
Ryker: “Fine.” *consumes entire salt circle, then leaves to the scientist*
When he opens the door he sees nothing but wight for miles.
Ryker: “Where are the scientists! Gah!”
Evelin: * pretends she didn’t hear.* 
Ryker: *smashes speaker in the top corner* “Now you can’t get any instructions. Good luck with your experiment now.”
Evelin: * flinches but doesn’t respond.* they will come when they find out he broke it. They’ll give me the instructions. They’ll replace the salt too. And get rid of him. 
Ryker: “They can’t get rid of me. Because you don’t technically exist.”
Evelin: don’t listen to him. He’s lying. He’s trying to get in your head.
Ryker: “Am I?”
Evelin:* nods.* 
Ryker: “Well if I’m trying to get in your head, it’s too late, I can read minds.”
Evelin:  I know. I’m not stupid. 
Ryker: “So will you tell me? Or are you just gonna sit here for eternity?”
Evelin: no.
Suddenly the world begins to deteriorate sending Ryker back to reflections
Dream: “ where did you go?” 
Ryker: “Into the recording.”
Dream: “ how’d it go?” 
Ryker: “Not well. You’re pretty stubborn. Maybe if we try again…but if you come in…”
Dream: “ you do realize that she and I are two different people.”* laughs.* “ You really thought we were the same? The first thing I remember is waking up in a barrier I couldn’t pass through.” 
Ryker: “So you’re the demon.”
Dream: “ yup. Well kinda.” 
Ryker: “I need to get to the people. Come on. You can help me.”
Dream: “ no I can’t.” 
Ryker: “Please.”
Dream: “ I can’t!” 
Ryker: “Fine. I’ll just physically track the tape.” *casts a spell on it* “This will take me right to them hopefully.”
There’s nothing to track them with
Ryker: *sighs* “It didn’t work.” *pauses* “But if I can find that face…” *eyes light up* “I’ll be right back.” *teleports to SOUR* “Wiziker!” 
Wiziker: *appears* “Yes?”
Ryker: “I need you to go through our databases for a match with any of these faces in it. And I mean every universe I took over. And do it quickly.”
Wiziker: *disappears and comes back with the results: “*insert results here*”
There was literally only Evelin’s face on it. 
Wiziker: “We only got Dream…but it was different.”
Ryker: *sighs* “That makes sense.” *returns though, requesting access to Reflections*
Dream: * let’s him in. * “ What's up?” 
Ryker: “I tried face analysis. It obviously didn’t work.” *pauses* “Could there be someone else who knows about them?”
Dream: “ not that I know of.”
Ryker: “The only other person I know that went under a transformation is Rae. Could she know something?”
Dream: “ why would I know?” 
Ryker: “Let’s try her.” *teleports to Rae*
Rae: * is having tea with Lottie Darcy.* “ oh hey.”
Lottie Darcy: “ GOOD SIR! WHAT ON EARTH ARE YOU DOING HERE?!” 
Ryker: “Interviewing Rae. It’s a pleasure to meet you Lottie.” *pauses* “Now Rae, would you know anything about lab experiments with a young boy scientist and two older ones?”
Rae: “ …. noooooooo. Why?” 
Ryker: “Have you ever seen anyone on this video tape?” *you get the VCR gist*
Rae: “um no? we're, did you get this?”
Ryker: “My pocket.”
Rae: *rolls eyes.* “ You know what I mean.”
Lottie Darcy: “ hmmp, Rae we’re supposed to be having tea!” 
Rae: “ in a minute Lottie Darcy.” 
Ryker: “Why’d you care so much about the tape? Do you know something?”
Rae: “ no. This just looks important. And knowing your history I’m worried about what you plan to do with it.”
Ryker: “So you don’t know anything?” 
Rae: “ No sorry. Did you take a closer look at that thing?” 
Ryker: “What thing? The tape?” *looks at tape closer*
It’s a tape
Rae: “ yeah I’ve been on more adventures to find out more about myself than you can shake a basket of exotic butters at and one clue can often be more than it seems.” 
Ryker: *hands tape to her* “See anything?”
Rae: * looks at it for a minute then laughs.* “ check the back.”
Ryker: *checks the back*
Written on the back it says ‘ to be continued in tape #2
Ryker: “So what you’re saying is that I need to find another tape. Sigh. Back to 4 hours of rooting around in garbage. Goodbye!” *attempts to teleport to Reflections*
Unfortunately doesn’t work
Dream: “ you know I have to let you in right?” 
Ryker: “Yeah. Can you?”
Dream: “ sure.”* let’s him in.*
Ryker: “So we’re searching for another tape.”
Dream: “ I know. Did you really not know that was back there?” 
Ryker: “No..” *heads to search for another tape*
Searches and finds nothing. 
Ryker: “Ima check where we found the tape, see if it’s there.”
There is no tape.
Ryker: “Where should we look?” 
Dream: “ probably not here. We’re not going to be lucky enough to find two tapes in the same place at the same time.”
Ryker: “Then where?”
Xin: * finishes the last of his army of statue’s and he snaps his fingers and they all come to life.* “ go search through that stuff until you find some important junk.” * They do that.*
They find a tape with ‘tape #2’ written on it.
Xin: “ ohhhhhhhhhhhh. What's in here.”
Dream: “ Hey Ryker. He found it.”
Ryker: *runs over and grabs it* “Thank you!” *summons VCR and begins to play tape*
Xin: “awwww I wanted it to be a pretty pretty princess diary”
Ryker: “It’s not.”
Xin: “no durr”
Meanwhile, Radharc enters sector 5
Radharc: “Cá bhfuil an diosca! Cár chuir mé iad!” *He finds it* “Anois, cá bhfuil an seinnteoir diosca flapach?”*Finds it*
He unplugs the floppy disk and a large earthquake begins in A1, A2, L32, Z54, B6 Radharc then leaves nightfall and all of nightfall is then sent into the floppy drive.
Radharc: *Shifts the ground around him and appears behind Xin silently* “What are you doing?” *Radharc sees the tape* “DO NOT PUT THAT TAPE IN!”
Ryker: *teleports away with the tape and VCR, requesting access to Reflections*
Jaeger: *Tries and fails to Escape the floppy disc at last second*
Radharc: “I am heading to the real world, as Radharc, who wants to come with me?”
Dream: *lets Ryker in*
Ryker: *plays recording* 
The recording begins with what looks like a supply closet. There is a boy in the room. He’s not the boy at the desk from the first one though but he looks very similar.He has sandy brown hair and brown eyes. 
Boy: “ uhhh hello. If you're watching this, that means you probably found my first tape and you want to know more. Well that is what I am here to do. My name is William.” * takes a shaky breath.* “ I hope if you're watching this you can come help. As soon as you can. I might not live if they find out that I made these. They're trying to cover the truth. Unfortunately I can't get this all out all at once. But don’t you worry. I’m going to make more. I don’t know how many. In this tape I want to talk about the plan. What they want to cover up. They have plans to make a weapon. Something they can use to make all their enemies disappear. But they are doing it in a way that is dangerous and killing many. Next tape I’m covering, the project D.R.E.A.M. That’s all I can share for now. I trust you to do the right thing even when I’m dead. Do the right thing.” 
Tape ends.
Ryker: “Now where could the next tape be?” *gets an idea and attempts to go inside this tape*
Does Not work. 
Ryker: *Grabs other tape and burns the reels together to form a super tape, making copies just in case this breaks the tapes* “Right. This should work now.” *goes into tape*
Does Not work still. All he’s done is destroys the tapes. 
Ryker: *pulls out copies and throw the other one away*
Dream: “ why are you trying to go into the tape?”
Ryker: “If I go into the second tape, I can ask the guy where he’s planning to hide the third and fourth ones.”
Dream: “ why not just find the others yourself?” 
Ryker: “This would just be quicker.”
Dream: “ Well you can’t get in.” 
Ryker: “Where do ya think we could find the tape?”
Dream: “ I dunno. It’s a big multiverse.”
Ryker: “I mean, we could try…” *pauses and shakes head* “I have NO idea.”
Dream: * shrugs.* “ alright.” 
Ryker: *frustrated* “I mean, I know another area riddled with different objects, but I doubt it would be there.” *opens a portal to SOUR Storage ‘Room’ and begins searching around in there*
Dream: “ uhhhhh ok.”
Ryker: *rooting through different items looking for the tape*
Isn’t there
Ryker: *calls over Wiziker* “Check the database for Tape a Labeled D.R.E.A.M, or anything like this one.” *hands a copy to Wiziker*
Wiziker: “Got it.” *checks databases*
Doesn't find anything 
Wiziker: “Nope. Sorry.”
Ryker: *sighs angrily* “Aggh! Where!” *checks tapes for fingerprints* 
There are fingerprints.
Ryker: *pauses* “Send the non-SOUR related finger prints through the database.” *hands the tape to Wiziker*
Wiziker: “Great.” *runs it through the multiversal database, matching with the Face ID, allowing multiple different special ability anatomists to look over it and find a solution.*
There are no fingerprints because the fingerprints they found were Rykers. 
Ryker: *angry* “What am I supposed to do!”
Cancer:*appears*”Something different, I suppose.”
Ryker: “Like?”
Cancer:”That's why I said I suppose, I mean I guess you could try an emotional link like what I use on you guys, and a couple other things.”
Ryker: “How would that do anything?”
Cancer:”i mean i guess you could go where it was made and go back in time or something like that”
Ryker: “I could…” *looks at Dream* “When did you become this?” *gestures to her*
Cancer:”yeah…, when was that, You said that you were trapped in reflections for a while, so that could have been a while ago. Or it could have been a couple years, we don’t really know, and I don't think that you know super well either.”
Dream: “ I dunno a year ago. And I didn't stay long enough to find out what my place of captivity was called.”
Cancer:”we don’t need that, we just needed the time, thank you. 
Dream: “ that might be wrong. I was put to sleep a lot, but from what I remember it was a year.” * pauses.* “ wait. Did anyone check the OTHER enormous void that pulls literally everything into it?”
Cancer:”what is that,...”
Dream: ‘ think about it. You’ll figure it out.”
Cancer:”the in between…?”
Dream; “ nope!”
Cancer:”Then what is it, nightfall…”
Dream: “ nope. Figure it out.”
Cancer:”how do you figure it out, is it shadesmar…”
Dream: “ No. You just do.”
Cancer:*grumbles…, looks for other dimensions, locates the void*
Dream: * snickers.*
Cancer:”Is it or is it not dream?”
Dream; “ is what it?”
Cancer:”the void.”
Dream: “ I dunno.”
Cancer:*sighs*”lets go look in the void”*teleports to the void and begins looking,*”Where do you think that it is?”
Dream: “ i Dunno.”
Cancer:”you are unhelpful”*uses mental link of other tape to find similar items*
There's no link. Has to find it by hand
Cancer:*continues searching*
Finds a tape
Cancer:*excited*”we can play it now!!!!”*goes back to sour and retrieves other tape to duplicate, spends some time learning to duplicate things. Duplicates tape.*”Now I have to learn  how to play it like ryker.”
Dream: “ just find a player thingy.”
Cancer:”okay.”*teleports to void and located tape player*”Kay, time to play it”*puts in player*
It's a recording of the duck song on repeat ten hours
Cancer:”either its at the end, or it not it”*fast forwards it and it continues to play the duck song, burns recorder to a crisp, returns to void to keep looking.*
Dream; “ what you don't want a recording of the duck song.”
Cancer:”NO, I do not need a recording of the duck song.”*gives original to ryker, and continues searching*
Xin: “ army Please begin black operation find that tape. I want half of you to go to the obvious places and the other look in the more obscure places.”
They find 5 tapes.
Cancer:*gives Xin the player, and reads all the titles of the tapes*
They are all scratched out.
Cancer:*puts them in the player*
The first one plays Rick Astley ‘ never gonna give you up.’
Cancer:”next”*puts the next one in the player*
It's the duck song.
Cancer:*pulls out and hurls it into reflections*”next”
Its the duck song
Cancer:*hurls it into reflections*”Why are there so many copies of the duck song in the void.”*puts the next one in*
Guess what? Its the duck song
Cancer:”We done yet?”
A strange mist comes over to them and everyone wakes up again!
Jake(Radharc): “DANG IT! I was just making muffins!”
Rae: “ dang it. I thought we agreed never to do this again.” 
Cancer:*summons sword and turns it into pan and knocks herself and Radharc out, returns to the multiverse*”I hate that.”*puts next tape in to the player*
Then they all fall back to sleep.
Radharc: “So, I am going to A1, this is your last chance to come.”
Jaeger: “I would like to come to A1!”
Rae: “ I’ll meet you there.” * teleports to A1.*
Radharc: “Welp, hear we go” *A loud crack sound happens and a door appears this is the door Radharc seems to know how to use and enters A1*
Ryker: *teleports to a different universe, copies an ability to pause time, pauses time and searches the entire multiverse for the tapes*
Radharc: “Oh, my A1 is…” welp let me see where is that rift”*Pulls out a strange dial and the door changes*
Cancer:*appears*”what's going on, why are we going to A1, are we going to find a tape recorder?”
Radharc: *Looks scared* “Cancer, I am afraid that where I am going is not safe for your type of being, You may want to leave.”
Cancer:”what type of being am I? And what type of being is Jaeger?”
Rae: * chills where she is.*
Radharc: “NO, You have to leave! This door can leave you trapped in all of eternity and time always” *Walks into the door and appears at the void*
Cancer:”okay…”*voids to the inbetween to watch*
Dream: “ ok why are we here again. I have a show to watch. Which is cancer finding clips of the duck song.”
Cancer:*appears in void far away from Radharc but he can still see them*
Rae: “ sooo what are we doing?”
Ryker: *opens door, and goes into the organized door rooms*
Cancer:”I don’t know”*duplicates tape player*”how about we listen to some lovely duck song”*puts the last tape into the player*
The tape plays “ bottom of the mind control facility’ song from the stanley parables.
Rae: "That's not the Duck song.”
Ryker: *checks the Farlands for a tape*
Doesn't find anything.
Cancer:*sighs*”I have found so many duck songs that it's not even funny. Look in the void, you might find something”
Rae: “ why don’t you check them to see what they are first?’’
Cancer:”we already checked all of them.”
Rae: “ then why didn’t you know what they were?’’
Cancer:”because the titles were all scratched out.”
Rae:“ hu. Weird.”
Cancer:”I think that someone put them in there to hide the tape.”*looks at dream*
Dream: ‘ why would i have that many copies of the duck song?” 
Cancer:”i don’t know, I just think that you might know were the tape is”*teleports to the void and continues searching for a while*
She finds ten tapes.
Cancer:”hmm”*duplicates the tape player and puts each one into a player and plays them*
The first one is the duck song part 2. Editor: “ Yo part 2”
Cancer:*Pushes every single player button*
Only one can play at a time.
Cancer:*pushes the second one*
Its the duck song part 3
Cancer:*pushes the third one*
It's the duck song remix.
Cancer:*pushes the fourth one*
She gets Rick rolled again. 
Cancer:*pushes the fifth one*
It's  a recording of Balloon boy saying ‘ hi.’
Cancer:*pushes the sixth one*
It's the duck song.
Cancer:*pushes the seventh one*
It's the duck song.
Cancer:*pushes the eighth one*
It's someone doing just dance.
Cancer:*pushes the ninth one*
You guys are never going to guess what this one is! It's the duck song.
Cancer:*burns all of the players*
They somehow don't burn.
Cancer:”how about we play them all at the same time, maybe they'll do something, I don’t know”
All the tapes play at the same time. It sounds like the duck song over and over and over again.
Cancer:*sighs*”back to the void”*
In the real world
Radharc: *Goes to [REDACTED]* “Now to plug it in ”
Radharc:*Plugs it into the computer*
The area around them begins to void and then night fall appears
Radharc: *Begins to chant and the rest of the area is hidden from the world *
Jaeger: *After being let out of the floppy disk Is whisked away to his real world counterpart, Jeffrey.*
Back at the void.
Cancer:*plays the tenth tape*
Willam is back in the broom closet. 
Willam: “ Welcome to my fourth tape. If you remember, the last one covered project D.R.E.A.M. So I don't think I need to go over that again. But as you know they were successful. And now they have been trying the project with other people. Kids, adults, anyone they can find that they know will keep their mouths shut. That I think was what lost Evelin. The real one. She trusted them too much. They use manipulation to turn her into a monster and now, she is gone. Now if you're ever offered a job as a volunteer to change the world, don't take it. It's not what you think. Now as always remember, do the right thing. Tape ends. 
Ryker: “FINALLY!”
Cancer:”that was really short, and we don’t even know what D.R.E.A.M stands for.”
Dream: “ I don't think that told us anything. Also that was the wrong tape. That was number 4. We want number 3.”
Cancer:”do you know where number 3 is? Is it back in the void”
Dream: ‘ why would i know? Just because I'm meta doesn't mean I know everything.”
Cancer:*sighs, returns to searching in the void*
All she finds are 8 tapes.
Cancer:*plays the tapes in order, one at a time.*
They’re the duck song!
Ryker: “Hand them to me.” *grabs them and duplicates them* “Right now if I do this…” *screws around with the tapes inside mechanica* “They should all play backwards.” *plays each of the tapes backwards, then plays them all backwards at once*
They’re the duck song. But backwards 
Dream: “ Did you guys think to check the tapes for clues?” 
Ryker: *checks the tapes for clues on the writing, putting them next to each other, checking for scratches, etc*
In tape #2 there is a hidden compartment
Ryker: *pulls thing out of compartment*
There is a slip of paper inside 
Ryker: *reads paper*
Paper says: “ for tape number three, a friend keeps it safe, she promises to keep it for life. She searches for her past. her life moves by fast.’ 
Ryker: “Dream! Where’s the tape?”
Dream: “ Why do you guys keep assuming I have the freaking tape!” 
Ryker: *holds up paper*
Dream: “ how do you know that’s referring to me?” 
Ryker: “Because it couldn’t be anyone else.”
Dream: “ how do you know that? There are lots of people!” 
Ryker: “Give me the tape Dream.”
Dream: “ I don’t have the tape! If I did, you would have already had it by now!” 
Ryker: “Well who else could it be?”
Dream: “ another person we don’t know yet! Cancer, snitch, Rae, Lottie Darcy, anyone else in the multiverse!” 
Ryker: *requests Rae, Lottie Darcy, and Snitches corpses to appear*
Snitch is just gone. No corpse. 
Rae: “ yes?” 
Ryker: “Do you know anything about this?” *hands paper to her*
Rae: “ I already told you. No.” 
Ryker: “Can I talk to Lottie?”
Rae: “ She doesn't have your tape either.” 
Ryker: “Can I ask her myself?”
Rae: “ no.” 
Ryker: “Why?”
Xin: “ can I have a diagram of her brain? I need it.”
Rae: “ Well, she’s not in a talking mood. And two I don’t know if you know this but she doesn't like you very much.” 
Ryker: “Rude. Fine I’ll just ask for the tape again.” *enters tape again*
He can’t. Something is stopping him.
Ryker: *glances at Dream* “Stop.”
Dream: “ stop what?” 
Ryker: “Why are you trying to stop me?“
Dream: “ I’m not.” 
Ryker: *sighs* “Help me somehow then.”
Dream: “ I can try but I-“ * her face grows pale.* 
Ryker: “Are you okay?”
Dream: * seems to glitch and falls over then disappears.* 
Ryker: *teleports to Reflections immediately, surpassing multiple different secret entrance and he installed*
Dream: * is lying on the floor.* 
Ryker: *jumps into Dreams mind*
Though she doesn't have a mind, she appears to still be able to have dreams. 
Ryker: *watches her dream*
In the dream she is sitting on a chair in a carpeted room. She looks scared. The man from the first recording is there. He is sitting in the chair next to her.
Man: * He is talking calmly like he’s trying to sooth a wild animal.* “ Evelin, I need you to trust me.”
Dream: * talks in Evelin’s British accent.* “ no no. I can’t. You- you hurt that boy. You lied to me!” * gets up and begins to back away.*
Ryker: *sensing that this is more than just a dream attempts exit through the Man’s side*
He can’t. It is only a dream. 
Man: “ Evelin. It’s ok. My friend is fine.”
Evelin: * looks at him in horror and begins to walk away slowly.*
Man: “ Evelin.”
Evelin: * turns and begins to bolt.* 
Man: “ Evelin, STOP!”
Evelin: * freezes.* 
Man: * smiles.* “ Now calm down.”
Evelin: * slowly relaxes. She stands straight. There is a dazed look in her eyes.* 
Man: “ good. Now come sit down and listen.”
Evelin: * reclaims her chair.* 
Man: “ Now are you listening?”
Evelin: * nods.*
Man: “ good. You are now going to trust me, ok?”
Evelin: “ ok.”
Man: “ you are going to forget what you saw, you are going to do everything I tell you and one more thing. You can’t tell anyone about this. No one. It will be our little secret. Don’t tell them anything. Do you promise?”
Evelin: “ I promise.”
Man: “ good girl. Now stay here.”
Man: * leaves.* 
There is a conversation outside but she doesn't seem to hear it.
Woman: “ Did it not go well?”
Man: “ I had to put her under.”
Woman: “ but we have no more slots.”
Man: “ I know. I let one go.”
Woman: “ who.”
Man: “ just one of the boys. William I think it was.”
The dream ends and Ryker is shoved out of Dream's head.
Dream: * moans.* “ what happened?” 
Ryker: *testing something, mimics the man’s voice to the exact pitch and vocal patterns and say* “Stand perfectly still.”
Dream: * gives him a confused look.* “ why? Also what are you doing with your voice?” * begins to wiggle just to spite Ryker.* 
Ryker: *intensifies voice* “Stand perfectly still.”
Dream: “ NO!” * continues wiggling.* 
Ryker: *pauses, changes shape to the man, then shouts* “Evelin, STOP!”
Dream: “ NO!” * doesn't stop.* 
Ryker: *reverts to normal* “Just testing.” *pauses* “Do you remember anything about your dream?”
Dream: “ no. What dream? I don’t think I can dream.”
Ryker: “Well you just did.”
Dream: “ no I didn’t. It was all black.” 
Ryker: *displays a mental projection of the dream*
Cancer:*watches through a mirror*”hmmm”
Ryker: “This is private!”
Dream: * looks confused.* “ What was that? It was just a black screen.” 
Ryker: “Just like…..” *pauses* “Weird.”
Dream: “ umm ok then.”
Rae: * slips into her backpack.*
Ryker: “You might not want to go in…” *pauses* “Just be careful.”
Rae: “ why? It's my backpack.”
Cancer:”yeah… are we looking for tapes in your backpack?”
Rae:* from in backpack.* “ …...no.” 
Cancer:”Then what are you doing in there?”*goes into backpack*
Rae: * takes notice and pretends to do something beside what she was going to do.*
Cancer:”what are you doing?”*goes over to Rae quietly on cat feet*
Rae: * knows she's there.* “ making a bucket.” 
Cancer:”cool. I don’t think that that was what you were doing, but cool.”
Rae: “ yeah it was.”
Cancer:”Now you're making me doubt you.”
Rae; “ why would i have any reason to lie to you?”
Cancer:”because you probably have an ulterior motive. Do you have something?”
Rae; “ no.”
Cancer:”well… I now doubt what you are saying because you are probably lying to me. Do I need to go get a ryker in order to find out what you are doing?”*changes into a large snake and quietly slithers around Rae’s legs*
Rae: * walks away.* “ You can go get Ryker if you want. I don't care.”
Cancer:”okayyy. Well alright then.”*shifts into a super small snake and hides behind something without Rae knowing.*
Rae: * still knows she's there. Is  making a bucket.*
Cancer:*makes an illusions snake that leaves the backpack.*
Rae: * STILL knows she's there.* 
Cancer:*quickly goes and bites rea’s neck and knocks her out with the snake venom*
Rae: * still can't be touched.*
Ryker: *pops head in backpack*
Cancer:”what are you doing”
Rae: “ Making a bucket.”
Cancer:”not you, I know that you're ‘making a bucket’. The question was directed at ryker”
Rae: “ He's spying on me like you.”
Cancer:”Well tell us what you're doing and we’ll leave you alone.”
Rae: “ I'm making a BUCKET.” 
Cancer:”well thats what youve been saying but i doubt that. I really doubt that”
Rae: “ Well that's clearly what I'm doing . And I don't care if you stay. I have nothing to hide.”
Cancer:”okay.”*changes to small gecko and sticks to wall and watches Rae*
Rae: * is making a bucket and doesn't seem to care.*
Ryker: “I was just curious.”
Rae: “ ok i'm just telling you it's a waste of time.”
Cancer:”curiosity killed the cat, didn’t it?”
Rae: * begins ignoring them.* 
Ryker: *nods* “Okay.”
Cancer:”alright”*crawls over above Rae’s head and watches her make her ‘bucket’”
Rae: *’makes bucket.*
Cancer:”make something besides a bucket. It's boring watching you just make a bucket. Do what you were doing before”
Rae: “ this is what I was doing before!”
Ryker: *leaves*
Cancer:*follows*”Why are we leaving? It's more interesting in there.”
Ryker: “Shh.”
Cancer:*quietly* ”okay…”*follows ryker as a large snake*
Dream: * mutters something.*
Rae: * hops out of her backpack and seems relieved about something, like she accomplished something important.*
Cancer:”yeah, you weren’t making a bucket”
Rae: “ Yes I was.”
Cancer:”yea…no, you weren’t and i think that we have all known since you went into your backpack”
Rae: “ I swear I was making a bucket.”
Cancer:”no, you weren’t”*changes to a bloodhound and goes into backpack, sniffing for anything that isn’t a bucket or monsters*
There's Raes stuff. 
Cancer:*goes through rea’s stuff*
She has maps of the multiverse, books, magic items of all sorts and that's about it.
Cancer:*looks through maps unconsciously using a photographic memory power to remember all of the maps, Looks through the books, and looks through the magic items*
They look normal.
Cancer:*begins to look for a secret room*
There is no secret room.
Cancer:*changes back to blood hound and looks for more things, excluding rea’s items and Lottie Darcie*
She finds nothing.
Cancer:* steals books and puts them in a restricted area in between*
Rae: * laughs.* “ you do realize I switched my books out for your duck song tapes before you could take them. The magic of freezing time.”
Cancer:*still puts tapes into restricted area of in between*”well then”*documents stopping time and learns incredibly quickly because she already knows how to slow down time*
Rae: “ ok.’’
Cancer:”what, you can copy powers, I choose to learn powers”
Rae: “ ok, i don't see why this matters. I just have better things to do with my time.”
Cancer:”Okay. Whatever”
Ryker: *thinks that its unfair everyone has a realm of their own, so he blocks off SOUR*
Dream: * decides that she should hide the tapes that they have already found for no reason.* 
Who: * appears where Ryker is.* “ Hey chicken face!” * holds out a tape. It has tape #3 on it. She waves it in his face then teleports away with it.* 
Ryker: *teleports to Who, pons her down, takes the tape, and leaves* “Thank you!” *plays tape in Reflections*
Cancer:*watches through a mirror *
Who: “ ha that was a decoy!” * holds the real one up. Then teleports away and any time someone comes near her she goes to a new spot in the multiverse.* 
In the real world
Jake(radharc):”Time to finally go on vacation”
Back to the multiverse
Dream: “ I feel accomplished!” 
Ryker: *tries to bribe Who with all sorts of things*
Who: “ I’ll give you the tape if you give me an axolotl in a top hat.” 
Ryker: “Talking or not?”
Who: “ I don’t care. So long as you can get me one.”
Ryker: *summons one that doesn’t talk*
Who: “ yay!” * tosses the tape to him and takes her axolotl and leaves.* 
Ryker: *gets tape, teleports to nightfall, and plays it*
The tape begins with a fuzzy image, then immediately changes to a rick roll at 20x speed. 
Ryker: “Great.” *kills axolotl*
Cancer:”you don’t know how many times I think that I’ve found it for it to be something else. It’s really annoying”
Dream: “ soooooo what do we do now?”
Cancer:*stops time, finds Who and ransacks all that she has on her*
Who: * has gold and minecraft eggs and that's it.*
Cancer:*yoinks a gold piece and duplicates it and stashes it in the restricted area of the inbetween, returns back to dream, unpauses time*
Who: * the amount of money that Who has multiplies with cancer's money intake.*
Cancer:”I don’t know”
Who: “ how dare you steal from a goddess. I'd be pretty mad if you didn’t just earn me some nice money.”
Cancer:”You wouldn’t care how much money you had if you were a ‘goddess’, you could just make more”
Who: “ I can't make more money just by snapping my fingers. My money multiplies with everyone else's.”
Cancer:”that makes no sense and you’re not a goddess”
Who: “ Sure I am.”
Cancer:”whatever, Dream, let's continue looking”
Dream: “ where?”
Cancer:”I wonder if we could spy on nightfall and see if there is something there”
Dream: “ you can do that. I've had enough of just watching.”
Cancer:”Well then what do you want to do?”
Dream: “ Now that's something I haven't been asked in a while. I don't know. But I can  name tons of things I don't want to do.”
Cancer:”Well then what are some things that you don’t want to do?”
Dream: “ well… never mind.”

Ryker: “Great.”
Dream: “ ok.”
Ryker: “I think I know an easier way to do this.” *pauses* “Dream, could I have some of your hair?”
Dream: “ no.” 
Ryker: “Why?”
Dream: “ because I don’t want you to have my hair.” 
Ryker: “Any DNA please, or any biological material.”
Dream: “ no.” 
Ryker: “Please!”
Dream: “ no!” 
Ryker; “I don’t get it. What are you worried about?”
Dream: “ don’t ask questions you don’t want to know the answers to.”  
Ryker: “But I do want the answer!”
Dream: “ you don’t know that.” 
Ryker: *snatches a hair and teleports away*
His hand goes through her and he runs off with nothing.
Ryker: “Wait…but I’m in reflections…”
Dream: “ no you're not. You're in nightfall.” 
Ryker: *shrugs it off and grabs one of the tapes (The DREAM ones)*
Jin: * grunts*
Jinn: “ since waking up its been more painful”
Jim: “ There we go, It’s good to be back.” 
Jim: * looks at dream.* “ So that's your energy signature.”* forces the atoms in the ground to create the atoms that are required her her to have a body giving her a temporary physical form while she is incorporeal*
Ryker: “Wanna go with me back in time as a bodyguard?”
Jim” who me?. I do Remember the L348 incident and all the previous ryker reincarnations before that?”
Ryker: *starts rewinding time on the tape until it becomes developed, rewinds it forward a bit, then casts a tracker spell on it in order to see where it came from, time traveling backwards the years it took to rewind.* “Yeah, you and whoever else wants to come.”
He can’t find where it’s from. It doesn't seem to have any way of connecting to a place.
Ryker: *looks for any dating inside the tape that most tapes have*

Ryker: “This is not okay.” *shivers* “This reminds me of the derpocolypse.”
Jim: “ dont worry its fresh”
Ryker: “No, this is not okay.”
Jim:” but why”
Ryker: *mutters* “None of this should be canon, or the old roleplays…but here we are.”
Let the story continue. Until next time.
Jim:” So there I was. Barbeque sauce on my shirt”
Jim: “ whit what happened”
There’s the normal data. 
Ryker: *checks date developed*
Date seems to be taken out. 
Jim: “ if we … I got nothing.”
Dream: “ I've got an idea. Why don't you stop trying to take shortcuts and actually use the clues you have to find the other tapes?”
Ryker: “I interviewed pretty much everyone that it could be.” *pauses* “All female characters I know.” *Teleports all Female Characters into a dark room in SOUR* “Right. One of you has a tape. None of you are leaving until I get it. All powers are shut off here. So good luck. And I’m sorry, but you’ll all have to wait.”
Rae: “ alright with me.” * jumps into her backpack.*
And is standing in a small backpack
Ryker: “Pocket dimensions are also disabled.”
Outside
Jim: “ Rae will win, she is Rykers daughter.” * pulls out 30$* “ Who wants to bet?”
Hestuia: “Win what?”
Jim: “ You can't lock a bunch of people in a room without a fist fight breaking out.”
Hestuia: “Yeah you can.”
Dream: *from inside the room* “ Well it depends on how sane the players are.”
Jim: “ None of you guys are sane. You have proved that time and time again.”
Dream; “ oh we've all established that. None of us are sane. Heck I think that at least half of us would destroy the multiverse if we wanted to. “
Jim: “ Yeah, so who do you think will win the fight?”
Dream: “ Well that depends. Are magic items allowed.”
Jim: “ no” 
Back in the dark room
Cancer:”why have you put me here, you know full well that I will get out.”
Ryker: “I’ve thought of every possibility.”
Jim: *on megaphone* “ Well who's going into the ring first?”
Cancer:”I don’t think that this is a fighting ring”
Jim: *on megaphone* “anything is a fighting ring if you fight in it.”
Cancer:”well okay, how good are any of you at fist fighting”
Jim: *on megaphone* “ I'm not the one fighting. You guys are”
Cancer:”I don’t think that I was talking to you”
Rae: “ oh honey you've got no idea.” 
Jim: *one megaphone* “fight, I haven't gambled in years
Cancer:”you are making zero sense jim”
Jim * getting angry.* “ fight before I kill you”
Rae: “ I'll fight anyone.”
Cancer:”I think that ryker only has that privilege”
Ryker: “Hurry up. I’m not letting y’all out.”
Cancer:”what are you wanting us to do…”
Rae: “ He thinks we have his tape.”
Cancer:”well, I don’t think that we do”
Ryker: *holds paper* “It has to be one of you.*
Paper says: “ for tape number three, a friend keeps it safe, she promises to keep it for life. She searches for her past. her life moves by fast.’ 
Jim: * on megaphone* “ yea and fight until one of you confesses.”
Cancer:”you are blood thirsty”
Rae: “ yup.”
Jim: “ well I am right now”
Cancer:”well of course”
Jim: “ So who has it?”
Cancer:”I don’t know, why do you think that we would know who it was.”
Rae: “ I've told you a million times. I don't have it.”
Ryker: “That’s rough. I guess we’ll have to wait.”
Cancer:”well then your going to have a lot of problems”
Jim: “ fight fight fight fight fight fight fight fight fight fight.” 
Cancer:*parkours up wall and pouches out microphone, backflips to ground, sticks it*”deal with that my friend, because you can’t come in here without losing your powers”
Jim: “ Sigh, you do realize that my time to reincarnate as a ryker is right now right?”
Cancer:”I don’t understand, plus, how the heck are you talking to us, I broke the microphone”
L349: “ Sorry but I am Ryker's servant.”
Cancer:”why hasn't he killed you, he killed all of the equal ryker’s, what merit did you show him that he kept you?”
L349: “ I'm a weak ryker.”
Ryker: “You can go now.”
Cancer:”thank you”
L349: “ Yes my lord.”
Fate: “ hey y'all”
Fate: “ Yeah I can reincarnate at will so what”
Fate: “ oooop” *reincarnated again*
John: *appears holding a piece of chalk.*
Josh: “ what he heck just happened. I haven't been able to reincarnate that fast in awhile” 
Josh: “ So who are you people? I haven't met any of you except- My word Ryker it’s been so long!”
Cancer:”who’s this guy, what's your name?, and can you get Ryker to release us please, he thinks that we have a tape and we don’t.”
Josh: “ im sorry but I dont have the pleasure of knowing you name”
Cancer:”my name is cancer, and what is yours random man who appeared out of nowhere, or do you just want me to call you that?”
Josh: “ appear out of nowhere. I, or my reincarnations, have been standing here the whole time.”
Ryker: *still sitting in the room, waiting*
Cancer:”well okay then, what is your name, I have been asking that the whole time”
Rae: * looks for a way of escape.
Cancer:*helps, whispers*”how are we planning on getting out of here, since we know that it isn’t us”
Rae: ‘’ leave that to me.” *Can’t grab anything out of her backpack because it is a pocket dimension that’s closed off* “ Dang it. Time for plan B.”
In the real world
Jaeger: “So, this is the real world, more chaotic than I was expecting anyways now that I can come back and forth, Back to the Multiverse!”
In the Multiverse
Ryker: *summons Jaeger, and gives him a throne room*
Jaeger: “ Ah, you must be the all powerful one I heard about, also didn’t I see you back in Nightfall when we were eating?”
Ryker: “Yeah, that's why I gave you a throne room.”
Jaeger: “Nice” *Shakes hand* “Why are all these people all rounded up?”
Ryker: “One of them has a tape.”
Jaeger: “ Aaaand let me guess, they say they don’t have it.”
Ryker: *nods* “I also found this note.” *hands note*
Jaeger: “ Why is it when people write notes they are extremely cryptic!?”
Ryker: “That's why I don’t write cryptic notes. I just say them.”
Jaeger: “Well I don’t know how we can get them to talk but we’ll try.”
Ryker: *nods*
Jaeger: “Well, do any of them have exploitable desires?”
Question
Josh: “ Who are you guys?”
Jaeger: “ I was in Nightfall with Radharc but Radharc brought it to the real world so I decided to come back to the multiverse and Ryker brought me here.”
Rae: * reaches into her pocket, grabs something out and then disappears.*
If you don’t recall, nothing works in SOUR without Rykers permission. So, that’s rough.
Rae: “ Well I tried.” * puts ear buds in and starts ignoring everyone until the fist fight starts.*
Ryker: “I truly do apologize. I don’t expect any of you to have the tape on you, but one of you must know where it is.”
Rae: * takes out one ear bud.* “ why?”  
Ryker: “Because of the note.” *hands note to her again*
Rae: “ I’ve read the note. And I could have helped you if you wanted.”
Ryker: “How?” *summons basic computer*
Rae: * shakes her head.* “ Sorry, if you expect my help it’s not going to be while I’m imprisoned.” 
Ryker: *glares at her* “You’ll rethink that when you’re STARVING!”
Rae: “ well if I had the tape which I don’t then i couldn’t give it to you if I were to die. Plus I’ve traveled around the multiverse, and it’s not the first time I’ve been starving.” * puts ear bud back in.*
Ryker: *increases temperature and humidity in the room* “I truly apologize.”
Rae: * doesn't care.* 
Ryker: *continues to raise temperature until it reaches 95 degrees*
Rae: * just takes her jacket off.* 
Ryker: *continues to raise temperature to 110 degrees*
Rae: “ You do realize that you're going to kill the other people in this room long before you get a reaction out of me.” 
Ryker: “I honestly do not care.” *shrinks room to the size of a closet*
Rae: * is ok with this fact.* 
Ryker: *turn incorpiable and invisible, and makes it the size of a linen closet*
Rae: “ ok lol.” 
Everyone in the room is cramped into the small room with absolutely no room for movement
Rae: * does not need to move. She is literally just listening to music.* 
Ryker: *shuts off power to phones*
Rae: * isn’t using a phone.* 
Ryker: *makes room utterly silent so they can’t even hear anything, then raises humidity to 50%*
Rae: * doesn't care.* 
Note: At this temperature and heat humans die in 10 minutes
Ryker: *waits for 8 minutes, then returns the temperature to normal, and slowly shrinks room even more, to the size of a small pillar then giggles, and frowns* “Why…am I enjoying this?” *shrugs and manually removes all hair and teeth from the group by yanking hard.*
Rae: * kicks him so he can’t touch her hair or teeth..* “ ok, you ready yet? This is getting rough.”
Wiziker: “Is he…going insane?”
Hestuia: *shrugs* “It’s not my problem.”
Ryker: *giggling uncontrollably* “I WILL get the tape! I must!” *suddenly realizes he didn’t check for clues on tape one and does so, as he coats all in the room in a layer of slime*
Tape is gone. 
Rae: *suddenly falls through the floor.* 
Ryker: *watching Rae, checking to see if she has the tape*
She didn’t take the tape.
Ryker: *teleports Rae back into the room, and puts up magical barriers*
She doesn't appear to exist. 
Ryker: *continues to follow her*
There is nowhere to follow because she doesn't exist. 
Ryker: *annoyed* “Right. So Rae is wandering around somewhere with my 3rd tape.”
Josh: “ So ryker how’s it going. I haven't seen you since the splitter ray incident.”
Cancer:*all of hair and things regrows*”You are going absolutely nuts buddy, you should calm down.”
Josh: “So what is wrong with being bald there are a lot of bald people in the world?” * begins drawing a complex circle on the ground.* “ Who wants to have a friendly battle?”
Cancer:”I don’t think that friendly and battle belong in the same sentence”
Josh:” I beg to differ. The word can be great if there is no harm intended.”
Cancer:”you got me at intended, harm can still happen even if it isn’t intended”
Josh: “ fair point, but nothing worth doing is done without the risk of harm.”
Cancer:”true, but there is added harm in fighting. If perhaps you had said ‘a friendly bout of sparring’ then it would be more friendly”
Josh: “ That is a fair point but where I'm from we just call it a battle. Sorry for the confusion” 
Cancer:”Okay, apology accepted. Now, can you get me out of here?”
Josh: “ maybe but I dont think ryker would like that. And I learned a long time ago that angering ryker is a bad idea. He is the best rithmatist I have ever seen.”
Cancer:”I'm not the most literate, what does rithmatist mean?”
Josh: “ oh It is quite a good sport where a select few can create many different things out of chalk.” * Once done with his circle he draws a unicorn that just stands there. He then scribbles down a lot of inscriptions for it as it moves really fast.*
Cancer:”interesting, I have never heard of this game.”
Josh: “ it is the only line of defense between my world and destruction as well as a great sport.”
Cancer:”this game has history. That is a good game”
Ryker: “Excuse me. Why are you both stupid?”
Cancer:”what do you mean…, the fact that were talking when Rae has left, or the fact that I’m still in here because you haven’t let me out, which would be error on your part”
Ryker: “I still can’t trust you.”
Cancer:”why? Is it because you still don’t have the tape?”
Ryker: *nods* 
Cancer:”okay… well can you make the room big again because i am about ready to clobber everyone else in here, and i think that if I clobber them then you won't find the tape if one of them has it”
Josh: “What tape?”
Jaeger: “ I don’t quite know what it has on it or why Ryker wants it, but it is important.”
Cancer:”It's basically dreams past in tape form and he really wants it for some reason. It's also really cramped”*grabs someone's head and smashes into wall, climbs on top*”that's better”
Josh: “my that was violent”
Jaeger:” I cannot help with the whole small room situation but I can go look for Ryker if you want me to.”
Cancer:”that would be nice, its less cramped now, but it's still small”
Jaeger:*Leaves to look for Ryker* “Want any refreshments while you wait?”
Cancer:”that would be nice, some lemonade bitte”
Jaeger:” I’ll see if I can find that and look for Ryker as well.”
Cancer:”Mmkay. Bye”
Jaeger:*Leaves to go do what he said.*
josh : “ I can't let you out but maybe someone else can”
Cancer:”Who would that be, Wiziker?”
Josh: “ no but… “* begins to physically change*
Cancer:”oh, you can reincarnate yourself so that ryker won’t get mad at you. But he would still get mad” 
???: “ What no ryker isn't stupid.” * He is a tall, powerfully built man with a huge stylized S on his chest.*
Cancer:”really”*smashes more peoples heads and gets on top of them, begins to climb up the concrete tube by pushing against the walls, gets to top, opens vent, climbs through vent and exits outside of the tube, runs outside and voids away following rea’s emotional link*
Ryker: *teleports Cancer back and deletes vent*
Dream: “ sooo what do we do now?”
Ryker: *shrugs* “Wait.”
Dream: “ ok.” 
Ryker: *gets an idea and teleports each person to separate  rooms, comfortable bedrooms with many amenities, but everything is built in such a way that it is impossible to leave. He teleports to Rains’s* “Hello Rain! Nice to meet you!”
Rain: * looks around in confusion.* “ Who are you?” 
Ryker: “I’m Ryker!”
Rain: “ oh hi. Uhhh can I go home?” 
Ryker: *hands paper to her* “This note says one of you has a tape, so just in case I’m withholding everyone.”
Rain: “ I’m sorry I don’t have your tape.” 
Ryker: “I’m afraid I can’t just take your word for it, sorry.”
Rain: “ well how could I prove it to you?” 
Ryker: “Allow me to put you in a state of hypnosis.”
Rain: “ what?” 
You forget this kid is 10. 
Ryker: “Essentially a form of taking control of you, it’s performed by average humans all the time.”
Rain: “ Esss- Essen- what?” 
Ryker: “Basically.”
Rain: “ I’m still confused.” 
Ryker: “I basically possess you and root through your brain.”
Rain: “ why? I mean you can but why?” 
Ryker: “To confirm that you don’t have the tape. Thanks for the permission.” *he puts her under a layer of hypnosis and makes her act like a chicken for a bit until he asks her* “Do you have my tape? Or do you know where it is?”
Rain: “ no.” 
Ryker: *unhypnotizes her* “You may go now.” *summons exit* “Nice to get to know you. I’ve heard good things.”
Rain: “ uhh ok.” 
Dream: * knocks her out, takes her home and then gas lights her into believing it was all just a dream.* 
Ryker: “What was that! Why?!” *sighs* “I mean I do have one idea.” *pauses* “Author?”
THE Author: “Me?” 
Ryker: “No, the yellow one.”
Author: “ yes?”
Ryker: “Where’s the tape?”
Author: “ bold of you to assume I’d give the story away.” 
Ryker: “You want to move the story along just as much as I do.”
Author: “ yes but you need to look for more clues. That’s the point of a multiversal hunt.”
Ryker: “I tried! Someone took the other tapes, or I totally would.”
Author: “ Oh Dream got bored and re-hid them a while ago.”
Dream: “ tattle-tell.” 
Ryker: “DREAM! Where are they?”
Dream: “ yes.”
Ryker: “Wait…I’ll be right back…” *rewinds time, presents Dream with the idea to take the tapes to bug himself, and then asks if he can have them* 
Past Dream: “ But what would be the fun in GIVING them to you?”
Ryker: “It would be funny. You’d bug me, and I know you’d like that, and I’ll give you some popcorn.”
Dream: “ if it would bug you then why are you encouraging it?” 
Ryker: “Because I love messing with myself.”
Meanwhile Somewhere else in SOUR
Wiziker:,”So, new guy Yay-grrr or something. What’s your deal?”
Jaeger: “I was in Nightfall before Radharc brought it to the real world, came back to the multiverse and Ryker brought me here during ‘The great interrogation’. “
Wiziker: “Right, but what’s your deal, your ‘superpower’”
Jaeger: “I mean I can turn most non-organic and non-metal materials into Steel, I can manipulate the air, so I can fly, I am invulnerable, as far as I have tested, I can also shoot energy blasts from my hands that are powerful enough to vaporize a regular human.”
Wiziker: “Cool. What’s your story? Where’d you come from before nightfall?”
Jaeger: “Ran into an Epic, what we call people with powers where I come from, who can, with enough effort, send people into other multiverses and timelines. I ended up getting lost but Radharc found me and let me live in Nightfall and research abilities.”
Wiziker: “Cool. I’m having an existential crisis that I’m a Lego character.”
Jaeger: “ I mean well if you are a LEGO figure, you act like a real person and are WAY more powerful than anything else LEGO so, I mean even if you are you can kill anyone, well except a few, that will try to make fun of you for it.”
Wiziker: “I feel out of place here. Not a lot of people here are as mature and collected as you.”
Jaeger:” I feel you, out of place has basically been my life when I got transported to this multiverse.”
Wiziker: *opens door* “If you want, this door will take you to anywhere in the multiverse you wish. I can’t leave, but you…you can go home.”
Jaeger: “No, I don’t think I will, before I got transported to this timeline life was rough. People in that world hated people with superpowers even if you saved their life, however, here having powers is normal and people don’t hate you for it.”
Wiziker: *shrugs* “Call this normal all you want, but look at where we are. A building full of infinite clones of one person serving him under one purpose. We aren’t in a democracy, we’re in a dystopian society.”
Jaeger:”Trust me this is better than where I came from, also the clones here aren’t that bad. One time I had to kill a guy who had a million of his clones all infesting a city, at least these ones don’t want to kill me… yet.”
Wiziker: *chuckles* “Just don’t make him mad.”
Jaeger: “I’ve been on uneasy alliances most of my life, I mean you haven’t even heard of a city that moves AND is made of salt, yes salt. Ryker doesn’t seem easy to anger as long as you don’t have anything you want.”
Wiziker: *shrugs* “It depends on his mood.”
Jaeger: “Can’t be as bad as the guy where, someone pinched him and he destroyed Asia. He could not control his power and it only activated when he was hurt, unfortunately he blew himself and an entire city up when people tried to experiment on him.”
Wiziker: “That’s a bit intense Sure, but sometimes Ryker destroys entire universes when he sneezes.”
Jaeger: “I mean he is very powerful but at least he knows how to use it unlike every joe schmoe in my world, when they get powers they go crazy not knowing how to use them.”
Wiziker: “Fair enough.” *pauses* “Well.”
Hestuia: “That is an okay Universe. Better than what happens to this place.”
Jaeger: “Trust from what I have seen this is better.”
Hestuia: *nods* “For now.”
Wiziker: “Do you miss anyone?”
Jaeger: “No, I had no friends, almost all hated me for being good. I have no regrets about getting sent here.”
Wiziker: *looks around* “None?”
Jaeger: “No, unfortunately nobody likes a hero until he is gone.”
Wiziker: *mutters* “Ryker used to be a hero…”
Jaeger: “It is sad when you try to help the world and realize how bad it has really gotten so you give up trying.”
Wiziker: “He didn’t give up, he became corrupt.”
Jaeger: “Well, you die a hero or live long enough to become the villain.” 
Wiziker: *shrugs* “Yeah, but what if he didn’t feel as powerful? What if he remained a hero?”
Hestuia: *pauses, looks like he’s about to say something, then doesn’t*
Jaeger: “Well, I mean after solving problems for a few years it gets boring and infuriating that people don’t learn and solve it themselves, I cannot blame Ryker for being corrupt.”
Hestuia: *does the same thing again*
Wiziker: “I Can. I was perfectly content beating up an evil pink Batman, and living in a cave.”
Jaeger: “Well for me he hasn’t really done anything too bad to me so for me he is really hard to blame.”
Josh: *from behind* “ How's it going?”
Wiziker: “Okay.” 
Back to the past.
Dream: “ you honestly expect me to believe that the tape you would have killed a person over, you now would be bugged if I gave you it now?” 
Ryker: “Yes. And I’d time travel to the past to take it from myself.”
Dream: “ ohhhh that makes more sense.”
Ryker: *nods* “So?”
Dream: “ well I'm not going to give them to you. I like my idea better.” 
Ryker: “Which is?”
Dream: * disappears and comes back.* “ hiding the tapes.”
Ryker: “Why?”
Dream: “ because I get to watch you struggle with finding them all over again.”
Ryker: *sighs and returns to base time* “Right Dream, are you going to give me hints to where the tapes are?”
Dream: “ yes there in the void.”
Ryker: *sends a small group of fast Rykers to search the void for the tapes*
After an hour of searching they finally find them all. 
Ryker: *checks all of the tapes over in multiple different circumstances, such as under a black light, or opening it and checking for different symbols or such.*
Under the black light on tape #4 is a code. 
Dream: * looks down and begins fidgeting with something.* 
Ryker: “Whatcha fidgeting with?” *pauses* “You got something you need to put a code into don’t you. And it’ll give us the third tape.”
Dream: “ no. Also that’s the fourth tape. I think that the clues for the fifth one.” 
Ryker: *examines tape 2 in more ways, including playing the tape backwards*
Finds nothing
Dream: * bites her lip.* 
Ryker: “Tell me!” *checks tape 2 for secrets*
He doesn't find anything. 
Ryker: *touches paper to tape, and shakes it, listening for something off*
Nothing happens 
Dream: * continues to fiddle.* 
Ryker: “Do you have any ideas?”
Dream: “ …..maybe.”
Ryker: “What?”
In [REDACTED]
Radharc: “That was a good break, welp, back to work” *Goes to computer and begins to do work*
Hestuia: *suddenly appears* “So, whatcha doin?”
Radharc: “I am improving the door system. I want it to be a little bit more humanity friendly.” *pause* “I do not want to have any more incidents with it.” *pauses* “Have you seen DREAM lately?”
Dream: “ why’d you say my name like that?’’  
Radharc: “There you are, I need to know, how do you keep getting in here? I am trying to improve the door system.”
Dream: “ That's for me to know and for you to never figure out.”
Radharc: “Also, you know I could just go into the control room and turn on travel detect, It will tell me how you got in here, I just wanted to know how.”
Dream: “ Do you have anything else you need from me? I'm trying to avoid Ryker.”
Radharc: “Has he found the 3rd tape?”
Dream: “ nope.”
Radharc: “Good, he does not need to know any more than he does about that. Trust me, that tape is bad news. I do not want ryker to get a hold of it” *begins to type again*
Hestuia: *squints* “Hmm…well that's interesting.”
Radharc: “What? Also, how did you get in here?”
Hestuia: “I can see the future.”
Radharc: “Dang it, I forgot well at least I know that there will still be loophole” *Sarcastically* “What did you think was interesting?”
Hestuia: “...Nothing.”
Radharc: “Do not Lie, what was it?”
Hestuia: “Another quest is about to unfold.’ *chuckles* “Good luck Vernin. I’ll see you soon.”
Radharc: *Kicks him out of nightfall for braking section: 4 part: 2 paragraph:7 clause: 2*
Hestuia: “You asked.” *returns* “I have many loopholes to get in here.”
Radharc: “Please leave, I can not guarantee your safety in just a moment, I am going to startup the new version of the door”
Hestuia: “I can guarantee my own safety.”
Radharc: “Okay” *flips a switch and  a extreme earthquake begins the vines appear*
Hestuia: “Well, goodb…” *gets cut off and sucked into the doors…landing in [REDACTED]*
Radharc: “Welp, this is the 2nd time this year”
THE Author: “Welp, now I don’t have any way to get a character here that isn’t being used at the moment.”
Present Author: “To be honest, I do not feel too bad for you, The other doors are not linked to this one so now he is going to have to deal with a place where there is no past, present, and future.”
THE Author: “I guided him to a universe. He’s fine.”
Present Author: “Okay, so he should be fine.”
Author: “ good.” 
Dream: “ Well now to go off and avoid Ryker.”
THE Author: “Great.”
Ryker: “You aren’t avoiding me!”
Dream: *disappears.*
Ryker: *follows her*
He can't.
Ryker: *annoyed*
Josh: “ my, so what is going on here?  Why do you need some tape’s, and why haven't you eviscerated the person annoying you?”
Ryker: “Because I’m being nice.”
Josh: “Okay. Anyway, what happened to you? You don't combined with smile or mimic any more?”
Ryker: *nods* “They’re dead. Again.”
Josh: * smiles * “ good, and the splitter ray?”
Cancer:”ya gunna let me out, just maybe”*is mad and glaring*
Ryker: “No.” *at Josh* “Why should I tell you?”
Cancer:”welllllll, then i’ll have to be rather annoying after you let me out”*turns into banshee and begins screaming*
Josh: * offended* “ We've been coleg’s since you first found the multiverse traveler.”
Cancer:”what? I'm confused”*continues screeching*
Josh: “ I was Ryker's buddy before he started absorbing powers.”
Ryker: “Are you insane? No.”
Cancer:”what happened?”
Josh: “ have you really forgotten?”
Ryker: “I remember everything. You may have met Mimick or Smile, but not me.”
Cancer:”he banished all the Rykers and took over the multiversal gem and all of that. That was irrelevant wasn’t it”
Josh: “$%^&^$. The eternal being is messing with your memories. Pardon the language.”
Ryker: “I documented it genius.” *pulls out Old Roleplay*

Cancer:”can I see that, I think  that we might need to corrupt it”*sarcasm, followed by more screeching*
Dream: * is watching from reflections, VERY amused.*
Ryker: *mutes Cancer*
Cancer:*turns into large flashing bug thing, is very bright and strobing and in a room that you can’t see into. Changes into pistol shrimp*
Ryker: *still has her muted*
Dream: * appears in the room Cancer is in.* “ Well well well, someones looking desperate.”
Cancer:*in tiny shrimp voice*”and? They are annoying and I want them to shut up and actually continue the interrogation, ya know?”*yelling in shrimp voice*“Actually finish finding the tapes!”*glares at speaker and camera*
Ryker: “That’s up to Dream.”
Dream: “ oh nothing much. I got bored of just watching so I decided to make a gravity falls reference.”
Cancer:”Really? Just get the tapes”
Josh: “ sighs “
Dream: * bites her lip.* “ …bold of you too.. Assume I know where they are.”
Cancer:”I don’t think that your controllers would let your past fall lost in the void, and you are the only known connection to them, it is deductive reasoning”
Ryker: “You hid them. Duh.”
Cancer:”yeah, and you’ve forgotten where they are, your commanders remember though, we need to talk to them”
Dream: “ you can't. I didn’t hide them. I get the feeling that if my ‘ commanders’ knew they would be gone.”
Ryker: “The ‘Commanders’ probably don’t know about them. She at least knows where the 3rd tape is though.”
Cancer:”I think so… but how do you get that feeling if you don’t know how to contact your commanders?”
Ryker: *shrugs* “It’s a feeling.”
Cancer:”I have a hard time trusting feelings. They are oftentimes misleading, especially if you have no reason to feel that feeling. I don’t trust feelings”
Dream: “ I'm not hiding anything! Why would i?!”
Cancer:”I think that you can answer that”
Dream: “ I'm not HIDING ANYTHING! What? Do you think I have a tape? Tape number three? Cause i don't!”
Cancer:”Then what are you ‘not’ hiding?”
Ryker: *nods* “You’re obviously hiding something.”
Dream: * lights on fire.* “ NO I’M NOT!!” 
Cancer:*sticks hand inside dream*
Her hand lights on fire.
Cancer:”you are hiding the tape inside of your reflection in this world. You are hiding something”
Ryker: *sighs* “Yes you are. Hestuia? Prove it.” 
Dream: * disappears.*
Hestuia: *doesn’t show up*
Cancer:”Hestuia”
Ryker: *shrugs* “Where could he be?” *attempts to enter reflections*
He can't.
Cancer:”well, she is hiding something, otherwise she would let you in without an issue”
Ryker: “What if she kidnapped Hestuia!”
Cancer:”he can see the future, he's not kidnapped”
Ryker: “But what if he kidnapped himself!”
Cancer:”that's not how that works”
In reflections. Ryker, Cancer, and any other character can't see this.
THE Author: *eating popcorn*
Author:*steals popping corn*
Dream: * looks stressed.*“ STOP IT!” * her posture changes to a more relaxed sitting position. In a British accent.* “Well then stop stalling and bloody tell them!” * back to stressed.* “NO!” * she makes a face at her reflection in the black rock.* “ * british.* that's them talking.”


Back In SOUR
Ryker: *attempts to go inside again*
He can’t.
Cancer:*attempts to view reflections*”she has shut us out”
She can't either. She has shut you guys out so stop trying!
 Radharc: *Appears out of a door* “Why are you guys fighting over the reflections?”
Cancer:”dreams hiding something. Also, can you let me out of this room?”
Radharc: “I am afraid that yes, she is hiding something for good reason, I can not let out, I am not allowed to extend my influence here, I am very limited to my power here.”
Cancer:”really?*sighs*”would you like to see my new creation of creatures?”*shifts into banshee with pistol shrimp claws, continues screeching and snapping*”Do you know what she's hiding?”
Radharc: “I will not tell you”*Leaves*
Cancer:*sits on floor with legs splayed out*
Back to reflections.
Dream; “ Just let me handle this.” * shifts back to the British accent.* “ how do you plan to do that? Hiding the truth?!” * she slowly takes out tape #3.* ‘’ she wont know i took it from her.”
Radharc: “Dream, why do you keep shifting, that is not healthy. Trust me”
Can't go into or see into reflections so he has no idea about the shifting.
Dream: * in the British accent.* “ So then what was the bloody point of stealing the tape from Rae if you're not going to give it to the people who NEED IT?! What was the point of saving Rae from Ryker?!” * shifts.* “ I don't know! But Radharc says Ryker shouldn’t know.” * shifts.* “ They're going to help us.” * shift.* “ not us. me and I don't need anyone.” * goes off to the void.*
Back at SOUR
Cancer:”hey, her links back, she must have left reflections”
Dream: * let's Cancer out of the room just to tie her down in a different room where her sword and armor doesn't work and can’t use her powers.*
Cancer:”what was the point of this? I couldn’t use my powers in the other room.”
Dream: “ because it's funny. Oh I've got to go, I've got some special plans.” 
Cancer:”you are nuts right now and something tells me that you don't got it all under control”*changes to bug to not die of asphyxiation*
Dream: “I've never been more sane.” * teleports away.*
Josh: “ okay”
Jaeger:”What is happening in here and why is Dream seem more unhinged than usual?”
steelheart: “ we should kill her.”
Jaeger: “Well you’ll have to deal with her power and then Ryker if you anger him.”
Cancer:*still a bug*”can you guys like… get me out of dreams room”
Steelheart: “ So we need to kill the incorporeal being. Do we know her weakness?”
Jaeger:” I don’t think people here have many weaknesses.”
Cancer:”I'm currently stuck, sooo. Yeah”
Ryker: “We just need to get into reflections.”
Steelheart: “ Can we do that by killing her?”
Ryker: “No, her weakness is that she corporeal in reflections.”
Cancer:”I am stuck, she is in reflections and shes nuts, how about we free one of the non nuts people please, cus ya know, that would be nice”
Jaeger: *Frees Cancer* “Steelheart, why do you want to kill Dream so badly again?”
Cancer:”thanks, yeah, why does she need to be not alive that much? I don’t think that it matters quite that much, until she goes completely nuts. I think that it's kind of like another ryker situation, with voices”
Jaeger:”True, I’m pretty sure we should not act hostile unless she tries to attack us.”
Cancer:”well then technically i've already been attacked but ya know”
Jaeger:” I mean actively try to kill us not contain.”
Steelheart: “ I don't know, She bugs me.”
Cancer:”As I said, I don't trust feelings. I think that we need to get that tape. I think that it's what's making her nuts, because she's hiding it as of now, i'm positive”
Jaeger: “ I don’t really know how we are going to get it away from Dream if they refuse to talk and are staying away from people, I mean we know brute force doesn’t work.”
Cancer:”I think that we need to get into reflections, or trick her”
Steelheart: “ or kill her.”
Cancer:”as previously stated, WE DON’T WANT TO KILL HER UNLESS SHE IS TRYING TO KILL US, HOW HAVE YOU NOT GOTTEN THAT?”
Steelheart: “ I don't know what you said.Those words were too big. Can I kill her now.”
Jaeger:” First of all we can’t even get to her, second, like half of the people here have prime invincibility.”
Steelheart: “ no one is invincible rykers death was the whole point of that.”
Cancer:”yeah, reflections is a big issue, if we are to kill her, then we need to either trap her in reflections, or trap her out of all of the voids and other universes. It would be easier to trap her into Reflections and then destroy reflections”
Jaeger: “ What I am trying to say is she is not the kind of person you can just walk in and blast.”
Cancer:”yeah, we have to trick and actually kill her, not her projection that she puts here
Rae: * appears* “ you guys are thinking WAY to hard about this.”,
Jaeger: “Brainstorming is better than just trying to rush in.”
Rae: “ I know but I also know a way to contain her.”
Cancer:”well what is it then, don't just say you know and then not tell us, you might end up tortured”*gestures at steelheart*
Jaeger: “ Why are we all being violent and if you have a way to contain her what does it require?”
Rae: “ salt.’’
Jaeger: “That’s it?”
Rae: “yes’’
Jaeger: “So where are we going to get the salt? Walmart?”
Rae: ‘’ you mean you don't carry around salt?’’
Jaeger: “No, because I might turn it into steel filings.”
Steelheart: “ those are good for killing people” 
Jaeger: “It’s usually faster to just suck the air out of their lungs or blast them.”
Steelheart” but that's less fun. Also follow the link “
Jaeger: “If you wanted to have fun you would just carve a spear and turn it into steel or fly them into space with wind manipulation.”
Ryker: *summons salt*
Jaeger: “Why don’t you make a device to precisely place the salt or like a salt flamethrower or I could make it fly around with my wind manipulation . . .”
Steelheart: “Yes violence.”
Jaeger: “I’m just trying to say if we need to get the salt near Dream how are we going to do it?”
Steelheart: “ but still violence
Jaeger: “I don’t think the salt hurts dream, just contains them.”
Steelheart: “okay” * changes into an insanely muscled man.*
Ken: “ hi y'all I'm going to hibernate until while I manage The roleplay ” * disappears*
Jaeger: “Well, that happened.”
Ryker: *awkward silence*
Jaeger:”So you wanna go eat dinner or whatever meal time it is now?”
Ryker: “You mean Dodecahedron?”
Jaeger: “Sure what do you have to eat.”
Ryker: “Anything.”
Jaeger: “I just realized I can eat literally anything because I am invincible.”
Ryker: *nods*
Jaeger:“Want to find out the taste of weird things that would kill us normally?”
Ryker: “Like?”
Jaeger: “ A multitude of liquid metals and things like Cyanide, if you have anything why not try everything, especially if you are invincible.”
Rae: “ You should try eating something like glue. I've always been curious what would happen if someone ate glue, like would it stick your mouth shut or just make it sticky? Also different materials work differently in SOUR  so it could have an entirely different effect.”
Cancer:”no… I think that Elmer’s dissolves, but like super glue, now I’m curious. Also, we have to get into reflections for the salt to really work, because all that we see here is just an image, a clone of the dream in reflections. We have to trap the real dream that’s  in reflections with the salt, unless we could get the real dream out of reflections and then trap her with the salt.”
Ryker: “Here’s a complex idea that might work. I…yknow what, I’ll show you.” *time travels back to when Dream had her dream, hides in Reflections, and just waits for a while, until the time when he has the idea*
He can’t make a portal. the portal seems to shut on its own 
Author: “ Oh for heaven's sake, that’s not going to work!”
Ryker: “Why!”
Author: “ one the portals gone. Two all that will do is trap the past Dream. Besides, there are way easier ways to get into reflections.” 
Ryker: “Like?”
Author: “ check the present.”
Ryker: *returns to present* “So then what do I do?”
A mirror by him begins to rapidly switch from normal to the reflections.
Dreams screaming is heard. 
Ryker: *spits on mirror and attempts to walk through*
He can go through the mirror into reflections. 
Ryker: *does so, shattering the mirror behind him*
Reflections seems to be sucking stuff in and throwing them out again at rapid speed.
Ryker: *walks to the eye of the storm, most likely Dream*
Dream: * is grasping her head like it hurts. There are tools by her that seemed to be discarded. When he approached her head snaps up. She stands and takes out tape # 3.* “ move and I’ll destroy it!” 
Ryker: “Evelin? Are you there?”
Dream: * in a British accent.* “ working on it!” 
Ryker: “Move huh? Okay. I won’t move.” *attempts to nudge Evelin with his mind without nudging Dream*
Dream: * fidgets but otherwise doesn't move. Lights hand the tape isn’t in on fire and moves it towards the tape.* 
Ryker: “Wait!”
Dream: * stops.* 
Ryker: “Can I do one thing?  I’ve got something in my backpack…”
Dream: * nods.* “ make a move towards me and I’ll melt it!”
Ryker: *pulls a familiarly shaped gun out of his backpack slowly* “This all right?”
Dream: “ shoot and the tape goes down with me!” * moves the hand with fire in it closer to the tape.* 
Ryker: “You don’t know what this +does, do you?”
Dream: “ the splinter ray.” 
Ryker: “It doesn’t just split people, yknow.”
Dream: “ True but you don't. I'm not anything separate from Dream.” * moves hand closer.* 
Ryker: *chuckles* “Of course you aren’t. But, are you sure that’s the tape?” *bluffing* “I replaced it.” *holds up Duck tape* “This is your tape.”
Dream: “I know. That’s why that isn’t the tape #3 either.”
Ryker: “Thanks for confirming that. Now, have a nice day.” *begins to leave*
Dream: * laughs.* “ fool.” * melts the #3 tape.* 
Ryker: *nods* “I agree, you are a fool.” *clones himself, while out of view and the clone continues to leave while he hides* 
Clone: “Goodbye.” *leaves*
Ryker: *pulls out splitter ray and shoots it while her back is turned, then grabs the tape and turns invisible*
Dream: * separates into two girls. One is Dream and the other one looks like Dream. But wearing a white  dress she also has green eyes.*
Girl: * gasps. In a British accent.* “ Oh, thank the stars. Freedom.” 
Ryker: *whispers at Girl* “Quick! The tape!”
Meanwhile in nightfall
Radharc: “NO”*Runs over to the control room*”I thought project namin…[REDACTED] I need to find that disk.”
A paper is lying on the floor in the control room, “It says: “Hi Radharc. It’s me! Hestuia.”
Radharc: *Writes*“How are you communicating”
There’s an arrow on the corner of the paper, telling him to flip it over “It says. I’m not communicating directly with you. I just left notes.”
Radharc: “Ohh, I get it” 
The paper reads “Check your watch” underneath his thumb. there’s a paper taped to his watch, reading “About now, Ryker should be playing the duck song“
Back in reflections
Girl: “ I-I melted it.” 
Dream: “ this is… weird.”
Ryker: “Oh, that WAS the tape!” *rewinds tape about 2 minutes in the past and plays it.*
It’s a recording of the duck song.
Ryker: “Sure you did.” *looks at them.* “Tape please.” *holds out hand*
Dream: “ it’s right there.” * points to melted remains of tape #3.* 
Back at nightfall
Radharc: *Is searching frantically until finally his eyes rest on a set of tapes labeled”SCIENTIST”* “If I want to find project [REDACTED] I am going to have to watch his tapes” *Grabs the first tape and puts it into a messein and it plays on a big screen*
The film begins to play:
Scientist is speaking:
“Hello future watchers of this tape, I am making these tapes to document my projects, In this tape I will be explaining project capter.” *Holds up a strange looking player with a floppy drive attached to it* This little thing here is  where you insert the floppy drive. All I have to do is plug this into th 
*The tape cuts and its Hestuia* *sarcastically “I’m Fine, thanks for worrying.” *cuts back to Scientist* “And now we have the owl trapped in the tape! Thank you for watching and remember MAY EARTH REIGN SUPREME” *The tape stops on a strange screen with symbols all over it*
Radharc: “No, next tape” *Grabs tape labeled The thought of time*
The film begins:
The tape begins by showing a strange timeline then the time line comes out of the screen. It appears to show all events starting at the start of the tapes to the last one made. It then at the top shows  a symbol.
Radharc: *excited* “Yes, this shows when and where each tape was made by Lab Experimenting (on) Multiversal Objects (and) Nonexistent Space, or LEMONS. It must be here” *Begins to look through the timeline.*
Reflections
Ryker: *Grabs tape, rewinds time on it a bit to when it is okay, then plays it.* “Finally.”
Cancer:*enters reflections and watches over Ryker’s shoulder silently*
The tape begins with William in the broom closet. He always looks nervous.
William: “ hello. Looks like you found my next tape. I apologize if it was a hassle to get it.  In this tape I will be talking about the project D.R.E.A.M. so to start the project was basically like everything else there doing here. They're trying to give their volunteers powers. After they began getting positive results they decided to test it on a human. Their volunteer they selected was a young girl named Evelin. They used a machine to combine her with a demon they managed to capture. They wanted to make a person that had the powers of a demon but the mortal abilities of a human.  This turned out successful. That's the first tape I made. I was there when it happened but I couldn't stop it. They are planning on using the project on other volunteers. I too have been signed up for testing. Remember , do the right thing.”
Tape ends.
Dream: “ hu.”
Cancer:”you good now, no more nutsy fits?”*is still standing over Rykers shoulders
Girl: “ I don't know.”
Dream: “ I don't think so.”
Girl: “ You are really weak when it comes to them aren't you?”
Cancer:”who’s ‘them’”
Both girls: * in unison.* “ I can't tell you.”
Cancer:”Well then why not, do you not remember?”
Girl: “ I dunno.”
Cancer:”who are you anyways, girl. The demon that looks like Dream is over there, so who are you?”
Girl: “ My name is Evelin. Pleased to make your acquaintance.”
Cancer:”you have very neat manners, unlike this buffoon”*gestures at ryker*”I am cancer,  and I am also pleased to make your acquaintance”
Evelin: “ i know. I'm just the other half of Dream. I see what she sees.”
Dream; “ the boring half.”
Cancer:”interesting, do you still see the same things, or is it different now?”*documents the splitter rays powers*
Evelin: “ It's different. I don't see what she sees anymore but I don't feel like I used to.”
Cancer:”hmm, I wonder if you're still connected to her.”
Evelin: “ maybe. Maybe we should recombine.”
Cancer:”I don’t think that that is a good idea, you were just going absolutely nuts, and I don’t think that we should make that possible again”
Evelin: “ We were only going nuts because they were in control.”
Cancer:”I don’t think that they can be in control anymore since you two have been separated. They might still be able to control one of you though.”
Evelin: “ Then why can't we share their names and information with you? Why do I still feel like they're always watching?”
Cancer:”I don’t know, it might be residual, and may go away in a while, but I don’t think that they can still keep control. I don’t think that that works out. The splitter ray separates things.”
Dream: “ Do I have a say in this?”
Cancer:”you do. You’ve just been quiet this whole time”
Dream: “ then why do you keep talking like neither of us get a choice? I mean isn't it our physical form?”
Cancer:”Well I'm bossy. What do you have to say?”
Dream: “ I don't know. It is nice to have Evelin not trying to control my actions, but at the same time it isn't the same without her.”
Cancer:”I think that that's just because you’ve been with her for so long.”
Dream: * eyes light up with an idea.* “ Ohhhhhhhh ive got the best idea ever.” * steals the splitter ray gun and shoots Cancer with it.*
Cancer:”what are you doing?”*uses her knowledge of the splitter ray to stall its effects*
Then, a strange sound passes through the reflections like foot on wood floor, then it stops
Back at nightfall in sector 5
Radharc: “Okay, so that tape must be here” *points to place on map* “If we find this tape then we can figure out where the rest of [REDACTED] in [REDACTED] are.”
Uair: “I think you a right”
Radharc: “Hold on, I think someone is here, I will be back”
Jaeger:*Comes back to Nightfall to check if Radharc is back from vacation*
Radharc: “There you are, where have you been?”
Jaeger: “ I went back to the multiverse, was transported to SOUR and met Ryker.”
Radharc: “Good job, you are finally starting to travel the world” *Sends a message to [REDACTED PEOPLE] “I will be back.”*
Jaeger: “Wait, how is the Scientist situation going?”
Radharc: “We are currently trying to locate the tape that contains footage of his… contact with the gems. We now know where it is and will be retrieving it so we can set up the final safeguard so he can never be brought back.”
Jaeger:” Do you have anything you want me to do if he comes back before you get the tape?”
Radharc: “I do not think he will, unless Ryker is stupid enough to bring him back.”
Jaeger:”Okay… but Ryker has been doing some dumb things lately so be careful.”
Radharc: “Yes, so maybe just go and back yourself up onto a disk.”
Jaeger: “Okay.” *Backs himself up just in case*
The reflections begin to shake as though an earthquake is happening. Though out of it pops an exact replica of cancer’s reflection
Cancer:”I don;t think that that was a good idea”
Dream: “ alright that's weird.” * closes off Reflections.*
Cancer:*exits Reflections terminating her reflection*
The being * still exist as a separate form * 
They * cocks her head *
Cancer:”What are you?”*points sword at being*
In reflections.
Dream: “ ok you ready? Nobody can hold us back now.”
Evelin: “ ok. Just keep it on hand. Just in case.” 
Dream: * recombines her and Evelin. * “ That's better.”
Outside of reflections
Cancer:*swings sword through being, removing it from existence*”We don't need more creatures wandering aimlessly.”
Radharc goes into the hall of mirrors and can see the reflections
Radharc: “WHAT THE HECK ARE YOU GUYS DOING IN THE REFLECTIONS!”
Jaeger: “What is happening?”
They: * turns into an exact replica of Jaeger right next to him*
Jaeger: “Have you read the rules of Nightfall?” *Gives Rulebook*
Radharc: “IMIGH AS SIN, AN BHFUIL A FHIOS AGAT CÉ HÉ AN CHONSALACH A BHÍONN SÍ ISTEACH ANN, MÁ DHÉANAMH GORTÚ DUITSE... AN BHFUIL A FHIOS AGAT Cé chomh hard is a bheinn!”
Jaeger:”Ah crap, what did they do?”
Dream: “ they were intruding on my peaceful tape burning!”
Jaeger: “Didn’t Ryker want that?”
Radharc: “Tá brón orm yelled mé, is é sin díreach, ní cobhsaí.”
They: * continues staring at him *
Jaeger:”Do you want me to get Radharc?”
Ryker: *dozed off, wakes up* “Didn’t I just…where’s my…huh! Fireball go!” *shoots fireball at They*
Jaeger: *Takes rulebook before it gets lit on fire*
Jaeger feels something papery on his back
Jaeger: “Did I get lit on fire too? I hope not because I like this outfit.”
The paper falls off. On one side it says “Kick me.” It also says to turn it over.
Jaeger: “People do realize that if they kick me they will break their foot.” *Moves away turns paper over with wind manipulation*
The paper says “Hey. Sorry for the joke. This is Hestuia. Sup. I’m kinda lonely.”
Jaeger: “Did you touch the door that Radharc told you not to?”
Hestuia: *check in your hair*
Jaeger: *Checks hair*
Hestuia: “Yes. On purpose.” *check shoes*
Jaeger: *Takes shoes off and checks* 
Hestuia: “Ha. I made you take off your shoes. Idiot.”
Jaeger: “ Oh well, I should have expected something.”
Hestuia: *bought paper that laughs at you*
Jaeger: “Oh, by the way, could you tell Ryker that if he keeps doing stupid stuff Scientist will come back, according to Radharc.”
Hestuia: *After he Checks other shoe* “Done. He’s not afraid of Scientist.”
Jaeger: “ I know I just really don’t want to deal with him right now and I would give a heads up so he knows. ”
Wiziker: “Hestuia leaving you random notes everywhere?”
Jaeger: “Yeah, and you guys do realize we are in nightfall, right?”
Wiziker: *shrugs* “Yeah. Ryker gave us access.”
Cancer:*appears*”yeah, we’re in nightfall” 
Jaeger: “So did you ever find tape #3?”
A note falls off of Cancers back “Yeah there’s some sort of battle in reflections right now.”
Cancer:*shows them the note*”i'm being haunted by hestuia as well it seems. And yes, we did find the tape”
A holograph of Hestuia appears
Hestuia: “I decided to record myself instead.”
Cancer:”that’s a little easier to read than the notes, plus a lot quicker and clearer”
Hestuia: *nods* “You’re right.”
Reflections
Ryker: *looks around, sees splitter ray and yanks it back* “That’s mine.” *begins shooting it at They*
Dream: * ducks and sends Ryker out of reflections.* 
Ryker: “No.” *he doesn’t leave* “You can’t do anything to stop me from being here. I was nice till now, following your author's plans. But no.”
Dream: “ my authors?”
Ryker: *mutters* “Nothing important.”
Dream; “ Just because we are typed by the same person doesn't mean that she's my author.”
The fourth wall:*dead again* The Editor: “Oof”
Ryker: *shrugs* “Yeah, it does.”
Cancer’s voice:”yeah, I think soooo”*coming from a mirror within reflections, you can see her face, floating within the in between. The mirror begins to float and drifts over by Ryker.*”so, how do you think that this works, because she is your author whether you like it or not.”
Dream: “ more like I belong to her. I'm her character. ”
Cancer:”yes, you are, just like we are all characters of authors. How do you think that this works?”
Dream: ‘ I dunno.”
Present Author: “RYKER ELTREPAH, this is enough! You have become so intense after you entered the reflections! If you do not stop this madness I will interfere!”
Author: “ me too!” 
THE Author: “Intense? He’s just accomplishing goals I set for him, mainly figuring out the date, time, and location where they were first combined.”
A strange shaking ripples in the reflections.
Dream: “ I don't see why this matters. He can spend his precious time on figuring out stuff about me that I can't tell him.”
Cancer’s mirror:”Yeah, why can’t you tell us?”
Dream: “ because I can't.” 
Cancer:”I don't think that that is an answer. Because isn’t an answer”
Dream: “ well it's the answer you get. You can't make me answer.”
Cancer:”well you can answer and you will. But first, what was that shaking?”
Dream: “ Once again there is literally nothing you can do to make me answer, and two the authors.”
Cancer:”well you will, but what was that shaking?! Like I seriously think that we are overlooking that.”
Dream: “ there isn't anything I can do about that.”
Cancer:”well what was it?”
Radharc: “Has anyone seen a tape that says: “An atosú” It is one of scientists, it is the last one that is still not under my protection. Also, how is the tape found?” *Radharc wakes up*
Jake(Radharc): *Heads back* “Sorry, I keep waking up.”
Hestuia’s Holograph: “Check [REDACTED].”
Cancer:”we still need to find tape #5. And what was that shaking, nobody has answered this question and I think that we are overlooking this way too much.”
Ryker: “Nah, It’s fine. It’s not the end of the world. Now don’t mind me…” *attempts to clone Dream*
Cancer:”you're being sarcastic.”*sighs*
He can’t clone Dream. 
Ryker: *snatches a piece of her hair* “Thank you!” *teleports away, analyzes the hair, and rewinds time on it to the age in needs to be from the tapes, measures that length of time, time travels that far back, uses the hair to point to Evelins location, and arrives in the lab, about 20 minutes before the testing starts*
Raharc: “Well thanks for your help, I am going to check the void library, they have the largest collection of archived tapes, disks, etc.” *Opens door to the void library.*
Librarian: *pauses* “You again.”
Radharc:”Yes, I need this tape” *Shows the photo of the tape*
Librarian: *sighs and looks* “We don’t have it. Did you try [Redacted]?”
Radharc: “Yah, do you know anywhere else?”
Librarian: “Try A…wait…Hestuia said for you not to go there…hmm. Try SOUR’s storage. It’s got loads of junk like that.”
Jake(Radharc): “Thank you” *Goes back to SOUR* “Ryker!”
Wiziker: *appears* “He’s busy, what do you want?”
Jake: “Could I look in your tape collection?”
Wiziker: “Floor 3967 Area BXC, Door 247.”
Radharc: “Thanks” *Travels there*
Radharc sees that the room would take years to sort through
Radharc: “Oh, this should only take a few minutes” *Taps Cane on ground and all of the tapes fly past him then he sees it* “Finally, now time to head back to nightfall”
Ryker CAN'T find anything from Dream's hair! 
Ryker: “Fine. Excuse me for a moment.” *he begins to rewind time in Reflections until he sees Dream arrive there for the first time*
He can’t because time works differently in reflections.
Ryker: *frustrated* “Any ideas guys?”
Dream: “ I stopped helping you when you attacked me.”
Ryker: “I attacked you because you obviously couldn’t be trusted.”
Radharc: “You 2 give me migraines.”
Dream: “ Well I still refuse to help you.” 
Ryker: *frustrated* “Then will someone else?”
Cancer’s mirror:”well I would like to help, but I don’t know very much about dream, so  I don’t think that I will be much help.”
Ryker: “Who does…wait!” *goes into tape #1*
Cancer:*is sitting, waiting*”Well, does anyone else know anything?”
Hestuia’s Hologram: *nods*
Dream: * raises hand.* 
Cancer:”well you’ve been very unhelpful of late dream, so i'm going to trust Hestu for now, but if you have information dream, im open to suggestions”
Dream: * laughs.* 
Hestuias Hologram: “I’m not telling you anything!”
Cancer:”you raised your hand.”*sigh*”i guess i'll have to rely on the original source, Dream”
Hestuia’s Hologram: “I know things, but if I tell you, it could screw up the timeline.”
Cancer:”well, thats why im trusting Dream”
Hestuia’s Hologram: *scoffs*
Dream: “ I'm not telling you either.”
Cancer:”well no wonder ryker went into the tape, you two are useless”
Meanwhile in Tape #1 Ryker finds himself back in the imaginary world. It seems to have restarted
Evelin: “ oh hello. Are you a volunteer too?”
Ryker: “Yes, but I don’t recall how I got here, do you recall?”
Evelin: “ yes. But I'm not allowed to tell anyone.”
Ryker: “But I was leaving…and I don’t remember how I got here. Could you help in any way?”
Evelin: “ Well I dunno. But you can stay here with me until we find someone who can.”
Ryker: *waits*
Nothing happens.
Evelin: * suddenly looks suspicious.* “ peanut?”
Ryker: *confused* “What?”
Evelin: “ You're not a volunteer!”
Ryker: “Yes I am!”
Evelin: “ Then why can't you answer in the right way?”
Ryker: “I’m allergic.”
Evelin: “ liar.” * turns her back on him.*
Ryker: “Is there some sort of codeword? I got one for myself. Cookie?”
Evelin: “ no that's not how it works. You're lying.”
Ryker: “But I’m not!” *grumpy* “You are!”
Evelin: “ then prove it.”
Ryker: “But that's the problem! I don’t remember anything before the test!”
Evelin: “ YoO! I NOT!”
Evelin: “ you're lying.”
Ryker: “Begins ignoring him.*
Ryker: *sighs* “Let's do this again.” *leaves tape, rewinds it, and goes back in*
The tape gets really hot and then explodes.
Ryker: “Good thing I have 7 copies!”
Cancer:” wasn’t that the reason that we made the copies? I’m going to join you this time.”
Ryker: *checks for tape 4 clue* 
He finds a piece of paper hidden in the tape's film. 
Ryker: *Reads it*
Cancer:”what's it say?”
The paper is a piece of a page from a book. The book is ‘Call of the wild.’
Cancer:”I don’t think that this is very useful. The book is about a dog who goes to the Yukon in Alaska and becomes a sled dog.”
Ryker: *reads it* “I know what call of the wild is about.”
It's from page 87.
Cancer:”well okay then. I don’t think that the text is useful. I think that the number is though”*goes to the library with ryker*
Ryker: *checks VOID Library*
Librarian: “What.”
Cancer:”is it not a public library?”
Ryker: “Do you have a copy of Call of the Wild book with page 87 missing?”
Librarian: *checks database* “37 of them, why?”
Cancer:”time to get looking, can you pull them up?”
Librarian: *summons stack of books*
Cancer:”time to get looking.”*begins looking through all of the books thoroughly*
They find no tape.
Cancer:”nothing, really”
Librarian: *desummons pile of books* “Anything else?”
Cancer:”do you have any information on where to find more of these books with page 87 missing? Actually…”*creates mental link to the books and creates a generalization of call of the wild books with page 87 missing*
Librarian: “I’m not Wikipedia.”
Cancer:”I didn’t think that you were”
Ryker: *calls “The Wild”* “Hello? Is this the wild?”
Wild: “ la gasp, you figured me out. Uhhh I mean no.”
Ryker: “I know what you did.”
Wild: “ YOU'LL NEVER TAKE ME ALIVE!” * books it out of there.*
Cancer:*creates emotional link on the Wild, the Wild is everywhere*”I can’t track it”
Ryker: “GIVE ME THE TAPE!”
Dream: “ who are you asking it from?”
Cancer:”we’re asking the wild”
Dream: “ the wild doesn't have your tape.”
Cancer:”then who does?”
Dream: “ I don't know. Did you look for the book the page is from?”
Cancer:”at the void library.”*begins looking everywhere with the generalized mental link*
Doesn't find anything.
They: * turns into dream *
They * enters the reflections *
They can’t. 
Ryker: *shines black light on page*
There’s nothing. 
Ryker: *frowns, copies it and stuffs it into the VCR*
He found nothing. 
Ryker: *annoyed, checks a copy of the book, and sees if there’s any difference between the two*
In the cover of one of the call of the wild books there is the name William written inside.
Ryker: “Ooooooh. Okay.” *begins to rewind time, watching what happens to the book*
Nothing happens. 
Ryker: *continues to rewind time*
Nothing happens.
Ryker: *continues*
He’s not going to find anything by rewinding time, so just stop.
Ryker: *returns to modern time* “So I’ve got this book. Now what?” *starts going through pages with the blacklight, checking for notes or such*
He doesn't find anything.
Ryker: *puts page back in book*
Jaeger: “Why are you searching through books of ‘Call of the wild’?”
Meanwhile
Radharc: “It is time, we will stop Scientist for ever” *puts in tape*
When the tape plays it shows Scientist, he looks at the camera strange: 
This, is my final tape, I am making this so if I die, I will be brought back. First, step is to recite the following words: “Scientist, you may return”, Then play this tape in reverse, when you do I shall return, and remember MAY EARTH REIGN SUPREME” The tape ends.
Radharc: “This is going to be slightly more complicated than I thought, let me try this” *Lights the tape on fire*
It does not work
Radharc: “I did not think that would work”
Uair: “What if you change its structure?”
Radharc: “I can try but I cannot see its make up very well” *Attempts to change it to gold*
It also does not work
Radharc: “I will just hide it in [REDACTED] for now while we think of a way to destroy it.” *Puts it in [REDACTED]*
Wiziker: *replaced tape with dummy tape, and teleported to SOUR* “This could come in handy.” *Decent evil laugh*
Radharc: “Now, where did I put my floppy disk reader.”
Back at SOUR
Cancer:”So watcha doing Wiziker?”*hangs down in front of him from the ceiling*
Dream: * laughs.* “ Wow you guys are oblivious.”
Cancer:*laughs*”I know, I prefer it that way”*is still on the ceiling*
A small hole in the ceiling appears for a moment, and a girl drops in. Literally
Kaveri: *Looks around, up at Cancer, then back down at the others, confused but smoothly covering it up* “What’s good, dawg?”
They: * struggles to speak and it comes out in dreams voice* “ hey “
Radharc: *Walks out of door* “Wait, am I in SOUR, oops, wrong place” *walks back through door*
Radharc then appears at bound
Radharc: “Ohh, I hate this place”
Bound now looks run down lots of the area around it is overgrown
Radharc: “Where did that disk go?” *Walks into a room and begins to look around a room full of computers*
They: * transforms into ryker *
Radharc: “Hello, they. Here it is” grabs disk* “I was looking for this “Scriosán téip éigeandála”” 
Cancer:*appears* ”What's that? I really need to learn how to understand different languages.”
Radharc: “That is confidential I am afraid. I must go” *Walks back through the door and it disappears.*
Cancer:*grumbles and gives stink eye. Returns to sour*
Back at SOUR
They: *enters under the guise of ryker.*
Cancer:*appears*”Who are you little girl?”*is on ceiling again*”Also,they,  I can tell that you aren’t ryker. You don’t have the same emotional link”
They: “what do you mean? I am ryker” 
Cancer:”whatever”
They: “ you doubt that?”
Wiziker got the achievement: “Failed to summon one of the most powerful and evil beings!!!”
Dream: “ hey person.”
Jaeger: “Which one?”
Dream; “ yes.” 
Jaeger: “ I see….”
Ryker got an achievement: “ most characters.”
They: “ unlimited characters. “
Jaeger: “Unlimited? Alright then, just try not to leave too many in obscurity.”
They: “ you haven't discovered half of them.”
Dream: *goes to Ryker.* “ You are so oblivious.” 
Jaeger: “So do you guys have any idea when or where the next tape is?”
Dream: * laughs.* “ no but I found a clue.” 
Jaeger: “Are you even going to give us it or are you just going to hide it like the tapes?”
Dream: “ you have to find it yourself.” 
Jaeger: “Of course.”
Dream: “ ur welcome.” * Dream teleports away and leaves note.* 
Ryker: *reads note*
Note: “ I'd take a closer look at that book.” 
Ryker: *looks at book*
There’s nothing. 
Jaeger: “Hey if it says to look through the book, make it clear.”
Ryker: *puts eye right up against the book cover*
He didn’t find anything. 
Jaeger: *Reads through the ENTIRE book CAREFULLY*
There is a note in the margins of page 189 that says ‘ bookshelf 67, shelf 3’ 
Ryker: “To the li abet rubs!” *teleports to the void library*
Librarian: “You again.”
Simon: "hello"
Cancer:”to the library”*is still on ceiling*
Dream: “ about time you got here.” 
Jaeger:*Joins Ryker in the library* “So, what are we looking for?”
Ryker: “Bookshelf 67! Shelf 3!”
Simon: "Nobody Pays attention to me! Am I not an interesting enough character?"
Author: “Because you only talk every 100 pages.”
Dream: “ What's up Simon?” 
Librarian: “The whole shelf?”
Cancer:”i don’t know”
Ryker: *nods*
Librarian: *summons entire shelf with 710393 books* “Here you go.”
Cancer:”i guess that we need to get looking”*is floating upside down*
Eileen: "I hate this place. Why are we here again?"
Dream: “ they're on a scavenger hunt.” 
Cancer:”to find a note or a tape or something like that.”
Ryker: *reads all books very rapidly*
Finds nothing. 
Ryker: *inspects shelf*
Simon: "what are you looking for?"
There is a nook in the shelf. 
Ryker: “Your mom.”
Cancer:*shoves arm into nook, is still upside down*
Simon: "You         know, it's kind of interesting that characters have relationships with each other, and my gimmick is that I have a personal relationship with author."
The nook opens up!
Ryker: *snatches everything in nook*
There is a tape! 
Cancer:*steals everything from ryker and flies into nook, makes a projector and stick it into the nook and makes it project onto a screen across the room so that everyone can see*
The tape is from the perspective of a camera. Dream is in a chamber. She looks angry. The speakers come on. A man’s voice is heard. It’s the man from the first tape.
Man: “ Hello? Evelin can you hear me?”
Dream: * glares at speaker.* “ Who are you?!”
Man: “ I’m a friend, Evelin. I’m just here to help you.”
Dream: “ my names not Evelin.”
Man: “ I’m terribly sorry. What is then?”
Dream: * looks down.* “ I don’t know.”
Man: “ You're just confused and I’m here to help you.”
Dream: “ I don’t trust you!”
Man: “ Evelin please-“
Dream: “ I said that’s not my name! DON'T CALL ME THAT!!” * lights on fire and insinterates speaker. She suddenly grabs her head in pain.*
The tape changes to outside the chamber. It looks like it’s from the camera glasses. The man is angrily holding down a button and watching Dream. There is a lady sitting next to him at a desk. He releases the button and Dream stops. 
Man: “ I don’t understand! Why isn’t it working?!”
Lady: “ Well it could be the fact that there are two conchansneses now.”
Man: “ What do you mean by that?!”
Lady: “ The girl was combined with something that had a conchancness in it. And it's supposed to only contain one.”
Man: “ So what?! She needs a second slot?!”
Lady: “ Well if you want her to cooperate then yes.” 
Man: “ We can't take that risk!”
Lady: “ We might have no other choice. She doesn't remember anything.”
Man: “ No, we'll find some other way.”
Tape ends.
Librarian: *shhhhhhhh*
Ryker: *inspects tape for clues*
Cancer:*exits the nook and incinerates the player and the screen, and duplicates the tape, vanishes*
Then a strange mental fog comes over Ryker and he sees 3 figures in his mind The dark one, Jake, and The man with 7 names they speak in unison
Beings: “Ryker, we are here to warn you, the tape that you plan to play will release a being of great evil, should you release him the very fabric of time is vulnerable, Do you want to continue with bringing him back?”
Ryker: “Why would DREAM’S tapes do that?”
Beings: *Laughs* “You know what we mean, would you like to proceed?”
Ryker: *confused* “What?”
Beings: “Could you contact Wizker mentally for us?”
Ryker: “Do it yourself.”
Beings: “Okay” *Brings Wiziker into the mental scape* “Wizker, is this your boss?”
Wiziker: *shrugs* “Yes.”
Beings: “Then do you wish to continue with bringing Scientist back?”
Wiziker: “I don’t know what you’re talking about.”
Beings: “Oh yes you do, we do not care, heck, we are not even actually real, we are just supposed to tell you the last step.”
Wiziker: *Looks at Ryker* “I DON’T know what you’re talking about.”
Beings: *Opens up his mind to show his thoughts* “You can not hide from your own thoughts!”
Wiziker: “[Redacted] you!”
Beings: “We will take that as a yes. The final step it to play the tape in Bound floor 1”
Wiziker: *glares at them, and then looks at Ryker* “I really don’t know what you’re talking about.”
Beings: “Stop trying to hide this, we have given you our message, we shall be hear if you need us”
Wiziker: *Looks at them again* “Shut UP!”
The vision ends
Ryker: *still checking tape*
Cancer:”what was that? You kinda just blanked out for a second”
Simon: "any Thing I can help with?"
Cancer:”I don’t think so, i mean, you can help us with finding the next tape”
Meanwhile, in CARD
Wiziker: *annoyed* “Bah! Stupid last step!” *teleports to BOUND, and attempts to summon Scientist*
In SOUR
SIMON: "YOUR MEAN."
Cancer:”i agree, he is mean”*teleports to Wiziker, behind him, silently*
BOUND
As the tape starts a strange sound comes from behind him and bound begins to come back together. Then the tv shows scientist and he reaches his hand to the screen and he begins to come out of the screen, as he does the air around wiziker begins to look like cracking glass then all of a sudden scientist appears in front of him
Scientist: “Finally, I return thank you wiziker, I will make sure you will be honored very highly in history! Now, For freeing me you may have me do one task, as long as it does not interfere with Ryker.”
Cancer:”finally, really.”
Wiziker: *sensed her* “I just want my bonds to Ryker broken.”
Simon: "hi"
Cancer:”you are a ryker, i think that that will be very hard”
Scientist: “I can do that, give me some room”*Every one is sent to the void except for wiziker, begins to chant in the torivor language* 
Wiziker has now lost his connection to Ryker and is now free
Cancer:*continues watching from the void*
Scientist: “Now, there is science to do”
Cancer:”okay”*teleports to back to ryker*
Wiziker: “Why thank you.”
Simon: "how can I be a more important character?"
Cancer:”I don’t know, make yourself more important”
Scientist: “Would you like me to send you to your home lands?”
Simon: "and I'm not reading the archives!"
Wiziker: “That’s all right.”
Cancer:”i don’t think that that will work. No thanks”
Scientist: “Now, to ryker” *teleports to Ryker*
At SOUR
Ryker: *still examining tape*
Cancer:*appears silently, is beginning to learn how to make no noise ever as  a power, is floating upside down again*
Scientist: “Hello master, I am back to serve you.”
Ryker: “Me? Who are you?”
Scientist: “Let me introduce myself” *Mentally sends him who he is and gives him back the memories of him*
Ryker: *chuckles* “Oh great. Another powerful being.”
Scientist: “I am only here to serve you for 3 more days.”
Cancer:”yeah, we need more powerful characters, but seriously, do you know how much you could do in three days, that's a long time that is really short”
Ryker: *shrugs* “I don’t know, go disappear from existence again. You seem kinda evil.”
Cancer:”couldn’t he just make himself be able to stay forever, he’s supposed to be super powerful.”*is still upside down and floating*
Scientist: “I mean I could, he can do what ever he wants me to do.”
Cancer:”do you have to listen to him?”
Ryker: “cease to exist.”
Scientist: “Okay, see you in 3 days.”*He then disappears and will come back in 3 days*
Cancer:”he’s just skipping through time like simon, I think. Blipping he calls it?”
Radharc: *Appers out of door* “How is the tape hunting going?”
Cancer:”he screwed up didn’t he”
Radharc: “What did he mess up?”
Cancer:**big inhale*”Wiziker summoned scientist and then cut ties with ryker and then scientist appeared hear and said that he was going to serve ryker which i don’t think that 
that is really true because he’s super powerful and then ryker told him to cease existing, which i think that he is just blipping, and now your here”*panting*
Radharc: *Yells a bad word in Irish* “NOOOO NO NO NO, He can not be back no no no! WE (Except for Ryker) ARE ALL DOOMED!” *Speaks very quietly* “I must prepare”
Cancer:”can I help, I would like to not be doomed.”
Dream: “ I have nothing better to do.”
Radharc: “There is little to be done, find a place to hide, and hope you have not made him mad and stay far away from The reflections, Nightfall, and L32”
Dream: “ I can’t.” 
Cancer:”well if he's super powerful then how is hiding very good, then can’t he just find us, also, what's so important about those places?”
Ryker: *clears throat* “L32? But…” *pauses* “Never mind.” *continues to examine tape* “He can’t…right?” *pauses* “Because then…” *frowns* “But…” *thinks* “Well technically…” *pauses* “Wait…Wiziker…?”
Wiziker: *doesn’t appear*
Ryker: “But…he has to come when I summon him…” *thinks* “Impossible! My bonds are…” *pauses* “Well not perfect…” *pockets tape and teleports to L32 then sighs* “I’m sorry.” *he pulls out a colorless gem, that looks like the multiversal gem* “I really am…” *he appears in front of a large planet* “Here we go…” *pauses* “First…I…”  *transforms into Old Ryker*
A missile comes flying at him from space
Ryker: *turns it back around, toward a large government building then clears throat and says to the planet.* “I am Ryker, ruler of the Multiverse, most powerful being of all time, the last being, surrender or die!” *mutters to himself* “With the power of the multiversal gem I will…”
Ships appear and begin shooting at him
Ryker: *stands there* “Excuse me, I was speaking. Now what was I saying…Right. You made me forget.” *crushes ships by looking at them* “Die.” *he begins altering terrain, and the shape of different planets and throwing the entire planet off track killing billions of people instantly*
???: *appears* “You will NOT destroy my world!” *he shoots a small rock at the gem in Rykers hand, and the hand, as well as the gem, fall off and land in the water* 
Ryker: “Oh no! Alas, I will return…with my army, be prepared!” *turns invisible and manipulates the hand to a scientist, slowly, taking about 3 hours*
A young man in a lab coat picks it up
????: “What’s this?” *looks at gem*
Another scientist walks up
?????: “Whatcha got there Rusulka? Is it from the being?”
Rusulka: “It’s…it’s hand…”
?????: “We could use it…as a Defense. Put it in the cloning chamber with the gem! Stat! It’ll take at least 3 months to create it. We want some Defence before it comes back.”
Rusulka: “There is one way to speed up the process…”
?????: “No!”
Rusulka: “I have to Chris.”
Chris: “I’m sorry. I can’t let you do this.”
Rusulka: “We’ll talk about this later.” *both leave in a rush*
Back in SOUR
Ryker: *sighs in relief, returns to normal, and begins to inspect tape again.*
Dream: “ where were you?”
He finds a few symbols scratched into the tape. 
Ryker: “Oh nowhere important.” *inspects symbols closer, then sees if he can recognize them from one of the billions of languages he speaks*
He can’t.
Ryker: “D’y’know what these symbols mean Dream?”
Dream: “ …….maybe” 
Ryker: “Will you tell me?”
Dream: “ tell you what?”
Ryker: “What the symbols mean.”
Dream: “…. How do you know I know?” 
Ryker: *sighs* “Right. You’re not gonna tell me anything.”
Dream: “ well that depends.”
Ryker: “On?”
Dream: “ what you plan to do about the Scientist guy.”
Ryker: “Why do you need to worry?”
Dream: “ because I don’t want you to turn evil.”
Ryker: *chuckles* “Why would a scientist make me evil?”
Dream: “ you went crazy over a tape.”
Ryker: *nods* “And? It’s not like I’d destroy a planet, or an entire military for my own safety or anything.”
Dream: “I’m still not convinced.” 
Ryker: “Can I convince in some way?”
Dream: “ go for it.” 
Ryker: “What do you want from me to be convinced?”
Dream: “ I don’t know.” 
Ryker: *sighs* “Well did you hear what I said to get rid of him? I just wanted him to die because he’s evil. It’s quite simple actually.”
Dream: “ hmmmm ok.” 
Meanwhile In the SOUR throne room…
Lazy Ryker:*sitting on throne*  “Yes, no, why would I want asparagus?”
Secret Ryker: *hiding in a corner* “I would like asparagus.”
Back to one of the random other rooms in SOUR
Ryker: “So can you translate the tape hieroglyphics?”
Dream: “ it says ‘where you want it.’ 
Ryker: “So… I really want it in my pocket.” *reaches in pocket*
It’s not there. 
Dream: * glitches again and falls over and disappears.*
Ryker: “Here we go again.” *teleports into reflections and to Dream*
WARNING FROM ACHIEVEMENT: “Scientist will return at 11:00. BE PREPARED”
Cancer:*hides in inbetween, can feel something brewing, disguises as a chair and begins using her learned power of complete silence* 
Hestuia’s Hologram: *in the inbetween* “This is a good hiding spot.”
Cancer:*is silent because she is a chair and using her silent power, so even if she yells she won’t make any noise*
Hestuia’s Hologram: “But y’know, if I can get to it, anyone you’re worried about can.”
Cancer:*stops using powers for a minute to talk to him*” I know, but i don’t think that they are worries about a chair in the middle of somewhere that occasionally sucks in and rejects objects. I’m not worried about people being able to get in here, im worried about dying by being somewhere where im not supposed to be, and here is somewhere where i’m not going to die instantly”
Hestuia: *nods*
Meanwhile in Secret Society (of) Wizikers Elude Existing Tyranny (SWEET)
Wiziker: “So we need to rebel before Scientist comes.”
Red Wiziker: “But Scientist is helping us.”
Green Wiziker: “But that’s only because we let him go.”
Purple Wiziker: “We’re fine. Just let Scientist do the heavy work.”
Orange Wiziker: “I don’t know guys…”
Wiziker: “We’ll be fine.”
Back to Ryker & Dream in Reflections
Ryker: “Dream? Again?” 
Radharc: “Dream, you need to get out of the reflections, they are about to get alot more dangerous. ”
Ryker: “Did you follow me?”
Radharc: “Yah”
Ryker: “I usually don’t use my back door…but this is private.”
Radharc: “The reflections will shatter”
A small tremor begins in SOUR
Ryker: “Crap.” *returns to SOUR to prepare*
All of the lights begin to flicker as  power is being drawn into a single point in the room. Then all begins to become quiet and all power is drawn to the center of the room
Ryker: “Leave.”
Scientist: *Appers* “IT IS GOOD TO BE BACK, now, where am I? Ahh I see, SOUR, I have no quarrel with you, I will leave now.” *He then travels to a room in bound full of mirrors.* “Where did I put that stone! Oh, here it is.”
The stone is a strange color that looks different to everyone who sees it, to scientist it looks like pure shadow
Scientist: “Now, I will finish my creation” *Walks over to a mirror* “The reflections must fall to rise a new” *puts his stone to a mirror and a large crack appears in the reflections* *Begins to look tired* “BRAKE!” 
Scientists can't shatter Reflections.
Scientist can't go to Reflections because that's not how it works. He does not have to follow the same rules as 
L32
Ryker: “Hurry up you two…” *starts pacing in the air* “Come on,...COME ON!”
In Reflections.
Dream: * begins thrashing.*
LEMONS
Rusulka: “I have to…”
Chris: “He won’t return that soon.”
Rusulka: “He will…”
???: “So are we doing this?”
Rusulka: “Yes.”
Chris: “No.”
???: “Decide.”
Ryker: *projects voice* “Y’all have 10 minutes till your demise.”
???: “I think that answers the question.”
Chris: “If anyone does it, I will. You have a family Rusulka.”
Rusulka: “But Chris.”
Chris: “Do it.”
???: “I’m sorry.” *cuts off Chris’s hand, and sows Ryker’s hand on*
Error 404: Lore not found. I’m cloaking the lore now again.
SOUR
Wiziker: “SWEET! TO ARMS! LET THE REBELLION RISE!” *on megaphone* “RYKER HAS GROWN WEAK! TOSS HIM OUT! I will be your new leader!”
Rae: “ oh no. this can't end well.”
A clash of powers begins….Will Ryker succeed? Will Scientist rise? Will Wiziker take over SOUR? Stay tuned until the next episode on: COSMIC CONVERGENCE!
