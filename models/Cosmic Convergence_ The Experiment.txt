Main Doc
The Third Part of Cosmic Convergence begins here:
In nightfall
Radharc: “HE IS COMING, MEET ME IN NIGHT FALL ALL WHO ARE CITIZENS.”
L32
Ryker: “I have one shot…”
LEMONS
???: Are you ready Chris?”
Chris: *nods* 
???: “Then let’s begin.” *turns on a lever*
In Between
Cancer:*is still in the inbetween as a silent chair watching and feeling scientist do things*
Reflections
Dream: * begins progecting her dream.*
It begins with Evelin sitting in a room with everyone's favorite scary man.
Man: “ Evelin do you know why i called you here?”
Evelin: “ no.”
Man: “ My friends told me you're nervous about how this experiment is going to end.”
Evelin: * nods.*
Man: “ Well I want you to meet somebody. This is my friend. He can tell the future. But don't tell anybody.”
There is no one there but Evelins eyes widen like she sees someone.
Evelin: “ wow”
Man: “ You can ask him any questions you want.”
Evelin: “ Will I be ok?”  * pauses.*  “ Are you sure?” * another pause.* “ ok”
Man: “ Thank you, zack.”
Evelin: “ thank you Zack.”
The dream ends.
SOUR
Wiziker: “DOWN WITH RYKER!!”
Hestuia: “Oh boy. Here we go…”
Scientist: *Appears* “What is happening!”
Hestuia: “In one word, YOU.”
Scientist: “Sounds about right, would you call this turmoil or even war?”
Hestuia: “Based on my outlook, I’d like to call this: THE WAR BETWEEN WORLDS.” *pauses* “But that’s just my opinion.”
Scientist:”Good”*Holds out stone and the war aspect is copied into it.*
Hestuia: “Oh, this won’t be good for anyone…not even you.” *smiles* “Good luck!” *pauses* “You’ll need it.”
Scientist: “I know, I can see it also. Now, 2 down 1 to go!”*Smiles* “I love war. Now, where are those fools from nightfall trying to hide now.” *Begins to look around.* *looks concerned for a moment and thinks “Does Radharc know my plans”* “Well, I will just have to find him myself.” *He sits down closes his eyes and when he opens them again they are purple*
In night fall(sector 5)
Radharc: “You four need to come here. ”
The others: *Appear* “Stay here”
Radharc: “Scientist is coming to nightfall right now.”
Rae: “ yes?”
Cancer:*a Chair appears*
Rae: * sits on Chair because she can.*
Cancer:*is okay with it*
Jaeger: “This is what I was worried about.”
Radharc:”ALL MEMBERS OF NIGHTFALL, THIS IS A LEVEL 10 emergency gather the main experiments and follow me to the command room.”
Rae: “ But what if you're not a member of nightfall?”
Radharc: “Bring whatever you think could harm an all powerful eternal being.”
Rae: “ tis a shame. I kinda liked Scientist.”
Radharc: “If you are a non member you may want to leave.”
Rae: ‘ and do what? Wait for the Multiverse to fall apart?” 
Cancer:*chair vanishes, is watching nightfall from in between*
Radharc: “Or you could stay here and watch the chaos unfold, BEGIN PREPARING FOR A LEVEL 11 shutdown if necessary.” 
Jaeger: “You can at least bring popcorn and refreshments if you are going to try to stay, Rae.”
Rae: “ ok.”
Jaeger: “Also if you hear or feel shaking and explosions, it is natural during level 11 shutdown.”
All of a sudden, a strange sound begins to come from the speakers and the scientists voice comes over the speakers
Scientist:”SURENDER NOW OR PREPARE TO FALL!”
Radharc: “Scientist you are not welcome here. Leave now or face the consequences”
Rae: “ dang I thought you liked me, Scientist.”
Cancer:*is just chillin, listening to nightfall, is still a silent chair*
Scientist: “YOU HAVE CHOSEN DEATH!”
Radharc: *Taps cane*
The ground around them begins to move around and scientist is mildly surprised
Scientist: “I will find you! I know you are in here somewhere!”
Jaeger: “Cool, are you going to keep yelling, you might strain your voice!”
Rae: * levitates.* 
Alex: “He is now in sector 1 sir, would you like to engage”
Jaeger: “MARCO!”
Rae: “ POLO!”
Cancer:*chair*
Radharc: “Yes”
Sector 5 is then flooded with a strange chemical.
Jaeger: “So, why exactly are you staying in Nightfall when it is probably going to explode?”
Scientist: “Are you actually trying to use my own poison against me I do not think so” *Snaps and it disappears*
Rae: * teleports away.*
Radharc: “Where is he now?”
Alex: “He is attempting to breach sector 3’s outer walls”
Scientist: “I Know you can hear me! I will find you”
Radharc: “Begin unplugging the cores. If night falls he will go down with it.”
Jaeger: “I will try to assist when possible.” *Helps Radharc as much as he can*
Radharc: “Everyone follow me, close your eyes, and plug your ears,” *Escorts them to the areas beyond sector 5*
Jaeger: “It’s really happening!?!”
Rae: * follows and does what he says.*
Cancer:*is listening and watching silently following, dampening her hearing and eyesight*
As they walk through sector 5 they can feel almost everything and nothing then as they walk out of it they feel an almost pulling sensation 
Radharc: “Welcome to sector 6, He cannot reach us here, I am going to turn off the last power stabilizer.” *Goes to panel*
Cancer:*exits, but continues watching*
Rae: “ Wait where's Ryker and Dream?”
Radharc: “They are dealing with their own problems.” *Pulls out mirror* “Dream, you need to get out of there, when night fall implodes, the reflections will also.”
Dream:* goes over.* “ I can't.’’
Radharc: “Every one hold on to something”
Rae:* holds on.*
Jaeger: *Braces himself*
Cancer:*goes far away, but continues watching*
A voice comes over the intercom: “Core is at 0% power, implosion imminent, evv.v.v.v.aaaaaaa.cccccccccccc” A large exploding sound comes from our side and one of the screens show everything being drawn to a single point. Then Everything Pre-sector 5 explodes outward
Scientist: “Finally, the last aspect,” *puts a broken piece of ruble to the stone**Raises hand with stone in it* “MAY EARTH REIGN SUPREME” *The stone glows bright then he disappears.*
In Sector 6
Radharc: “no, he has the stone, no,”*Looks depressed* “no, we are… lost, he, he, we are doomed.”
Jaeger: “What does the stone do?”
Radharc: “It is called the stone of eternity. With it he can undo the multiverse one universe at a time. It can only be created by someone who has broken time and collected its aspects 5 times.”
Jaeger: “Great, if the war that Ryker is fighting is not enough.”
Radharc: “Nightfall was the only thing preventing his final experiment. He is trying to make all of the multiverse like the torivor realm. No where will be safe from it, the only good thing is that it now needs to charge. That could take some time.” *Pulls out mirror* “I was worried about this. The reflections have been pushed off of the axis. They were not destroyed but it is going to be much more chaotic and dangerous.”
Dream: “ I'm working on fixing it.”
Radharc: “If anyone could do it, it would be you, be warned the further you go into them, the more chaotic it will be.”
Dream: “ I  can't tell you how many times Evelin has told me that.”
Radharc: “I know that because it is partly my fault. The realm of doors is directly linked to it.”
Dream: “ So Scientist has the last tape?”
Radharc: “Well, more like what was stored in it. He absorbed it into his stone and he wants to use it for later research.”
Dream; “ Well Ryker’s going to kill him over it.”
Radharc: “No, scientist is going to try and give it to him, if he can figure out how to get it out of the stone. Only 5 people actually know how to wield the stone. He is not one of those 5 though.” *Pauses* “4 of the 5 are in sector 5 right now.”
In the Inbetween
Cancer:*changes out of a chair, holds up a mirror*
Dream: “ yes?”
Cancer:”are you okay?”*the image of dream seems kinda fuzzy, but it's getting better*
Dream: “ I'm fine. Nothing can hurt me.” * is slowly fixing the broken parts of Reflections.*
Cancer:”how does that work? Can you show me?”
Dream: “ no.”
Cancer:”back to being annoying, okay.” *sighs, puts mirror down, she is floating in the abyss of the inbetween. Changes to her original form. It is an abyssy form and the inbetween around her seems to warp. It seems to be a dragon-like form with four wing-like appendages , absorbing all light and dimly glowing a deep cyan from the inside, reflecting on all of the facets of her glass-like scales. Her eyes glow a lighter cyan. Cancer seems to shift slightly in the inbetween. She opens her wings and voids out of the inbetween where the air doesn’t seem to warp, but she is still a glass-like form and absorbs all light and glows the same as before. The inbetween is the only place where the air warps around her. She seals off the inbetween from all except for her. She voids back to the inbetween and begins hunting for gem creatures in the far reaches.*
Meanwhile…Ryker is more calm now (L32)
Ryker: “Right then, I should probably stop Scientist.” *pauses* “Yeah.” *pauses* “Or…” *thinks* “Yeah…” *teleports directly to Scientist* “Right. The rock? If you want a deal, I’ll give ya one. Meet me in L32.” *vanishes*
SOUR
Wiziker: *sitting on a throne* “Well that was surprisingly easy…”
Lazy Ryker: *invisible* “You’ll see…” *he steals the Splitter Ray and teleports to the VOID library*
L32
The air begins to change and a large split in the air appears and scientist appears
Scientist: “How strange, I worked here for years.” *pauses* “Aperture was better.” *Chuckles* “Funny how that works.”
Dream: “ hey.”
Scientist: *Looks almost worried* “DREAM, how?”
Dream: “ you're going to need to be more specific if you're going to get upset.”
Scientist: “Are you linked to project DREAM?”
Dream: “ how did you know about that?”
Scientist: “I, well, I worked for [REDACTED], not on project DREAM but I did do the paperwork. I also recorded the tapes for my friend.”
Dream: “ you helped with the tapes?”
Scientist: “Help, I came up with the idea for recording his ideas.”
Dream: “ hu.”
Scientist: “I worked on the more, well, multiverse projects for them. Though for a time project DREAM and Project nam…” *Pauses* “Anyways, I had some involvement with it. Shame how it went down, also informational though.” *Pauses* “Do you know where Ryker is?”
Ryker: “Here.”
Scientist: “What did you need to see me for?”
Ryker: *looks at Dream* “Um…could you go Dream? To like SOUR or something?”
Scientist: “I can fix that” *Dream is then sent back to the reflections* “Yes?
”
Ryker: “Let me go grab something, I’ll be right back…” *teleports away to A2* 
A rumbling occurs and L32 and everything inside it is deleted.
Scientist: *Speaks to his mind*“Did you think I would actually send myself to L32? I knew from the beginning that it was a trap. I can see the future, remember.”
Ryker: *shrugs* “I had to try.”
Scientist: “I am slightly annoyed though you did delete one of my favorite clones.”
Ryker: *shrugs* “I want the stone. You do realize that magical multiversal rocks corrupt. I would know.”
Scientist: “I am afraid there is no stone anymore. I have completed the steps involving it.”
Ryker: *shrugs* “You didn’t have a lazy version of you in the way.”
Scientist: “I was always evil. You just do not pay attention to me. I am just good at hiding it.”
Ryker: “Why hide it. I don’t really see what the point in destroying the multiverse is though.”
Scientist: “I am not destroying it, I am simply making sure that I can continue to do experiments, I also no longer have a safe place to go to. Ever since the realm of torivors was destroyed. I have some other reasons also. They are Just not, well, ready yet.”
Ryker: “Do you want a lab? I can get you a lab. Or you can just use L32, it’s useless to me now.”
Scientist: “If all we I mean I wanted was a lab, The whole multiverse would be one.”
Ryker: “Well then what do you want?”
Scientist: *Smiles eerily*“You will know in due time.” *Then teleports to [UNKNOWN LOCATION]*
Ryker: “I can get you like anything.” *rolls eyes* “Whatever.” *sighs* “I should probably go back to SOUR.” *looks at L32* “I’m sorry Chris.” *teleports to SOUR, looks at state it's in, and says some non-PG words* “What happened here?”
Wiziker: “I took over. Goodbye.” *Ryker gets thrown out of SOUR*
Dream: * to Ryker.*“ That's rough buddy.”
Scientist: “Should have warned you, a war kind of started. So, good luck.”
Ryker: “You two men, just don’t mess with my stuff and we're good. And, if you can, leave Radharc alone.”
Scientist: “Wait, he is still alive! THAT LITTLE”*Calms down*”I can deal with him later. Do not worry I do not plan to get involved in the war for now. After all, I can’t lie.”
Ryker: *looks at Dream* “So, tapes?” *at Scientist* “Tapes?”
Dream: “ I don't have it.”
Scientist: “Well, what tapes do you have so far?”
Ryker: “1-5 I think.”
Scientist: “Okay, the 5th one is well, inaccessible for a moment, but the 6th one is located in,”*Thinks back* “Actually, it was in L32, that was the only one that we kept there.”
Ryker: “Excuse me for a sec…” *does time travel shenanigans to get tape and plays it*
It rick rolls him
Scientist: *Chuckles* “Sorry, I had to, it is the tape next to it. I just swapped the labels.”
Ryker: *time travel shenanigans part 2 and plays tape*
The tape is from the secret glasses. Someone walks into Dreams chamber. 
Dream: “ Who are you?!”
William: * is the one recording.*“ I'm just here to help you. I'm going to get you out of here.”
Dream: “ how do I know I can trust you? “
William: “You don't. But what do you have to lose?’’
Dream: * unsure.* “ ok’’
William: * hands her papers* “ These will help you. Ones a map of the facility, one’s places you can go where you will be safe. Use your powers. Don't stop running.” 
Dream: “ what do I do when I'm out?” 
William: “ hide.” * He opens the chamber door.* 
Dream: * goes out.* “ Wait!”
William: “ yes?’’
Dream: “ Can you tell me something?”
William: * nods.*
Dream: “ what's my name?’’
William: “ Your name is Dream.’’
The tape ends.
Scientist: *Noods* “That is one of the last records that I, did well, did not have to edit.”
Dream: “ or film.”
 Ryker: “Or…Catfish!” *pauses* “Making other people say things is fun.”
Author: “ oh my gosh! I just reread the part with Xin and his argument with logic.’’ 
Ryker: “The one wordy dialogue box thing?”
Author: “ oh right. It's just something that happened a while ago.”
Ryker: “It’s looking short so far. Good! It’ll be less scary.” *pauses* “Whoa. This’ll be talked about in the summary. Deep.”
Ryker: *looks up* “Would you two shut up?”
Meanwhile…In the word of Higher beings
Girl: “What’s Snape doing?”
Axolotl: *shrugs* “But good for Wiziker, am I right?”
Girl: *nods*
SOUR
Ryker: “Y'all need to stop breaking story immersion, even the existence of Aiolos was a stupid concept. He’s just what started the first loop.” *sees text below* “Oh for Pete’s….”
Meanwhile In the VOID Library
Lazy Ryker: “Hey Librarian.”
Librarian: “Yes?”
Lazy Ryker: “D’y’know where Hyper Ryker is.”
Librarian: *nods* “He’s been bugging me WAY too much. Check the exercise books.”
Lazy Ryker: *strolls toward exercise books and groans* “Hyper?”
Hyper Ryker: “Yeah?”
Lazy Ryker: “Let’s go.”
Hyper Ryker: *bouncing around* “Where!”
Lazy Ryker: *pauses* “I think….Meta Ryker is next.”
Hyper Ryker: *stops jumping* “But he ruins all the fun.”
Lazy Ryker: *shrugs* “He’s the closest.” 
Hyper: “Okay then.”
Lazy Ryker: *teleports them both away*
SOUR
Ryker: “So where’s tape 5?”
Dream: “ I don’t know.”
Ryker: “Scientist? If that even is your real name…”
Rae: “ hey y’all.” 
Who: * appears.* “ HEY EVERYONE!!!!! Oh hey chicken face.” 
Ryker: *sighs* “Hello Who.”
Who: “ so what we doing?’’
Rae: “ Oh no.”
They: * turns into scientist *
In between
Cancer:*has gathered a couple of gem creatures from the far reaches, and teleports back to the center and summons all of the creatures, and puts them into a marble, Leaving only an old gem monkey out. Changes the gem monkey back into his original form.*
Monkey man:”what do you want?”*is facing the wrong way because he is blind*
Cancer:”i'm over here”
Monkey man:”oh”*turns around*” Well, what do you want from me?”
Cancer:”I want you to finish teaching me, Prophet”
Prophet:”there was a reason why I stopped teaching you”
Cancer:”Well, I don’t care, and you will finish teaching me your trade.”
Prophet:”no”
Cancer:”Yes, you will, because you don’t have a choice.”*growls and steps forward menacingly*
Prophet:”you won’t hurt me”
Cancer:”yes, I will, and you will teach me.”
Prophet:*grudgingly*”fine, but don’t say that I didn’t warn you”
Cancer:”then let's get started”*stashes the gem animal marble and teleports them to a glass cave, where all light is absorbed, in the abyss of the inbetween*
Prophet:”I don’t like it here”
Cancer:”well, I don’t care. I do, so this is where your teaching me”
Prophet:”fine”*begins teaching her*
SOUR
Scientist: “Yes, well about tape 5, I am afraid that it is less, well, useable than the well rest”
The ghost of Snitch: * steals Scientist’s rock thing.* “ SHINNY!!!!!”
Rae: “ What in the multiverse was that?”
Ryker: *mumbling*
Rae:” what?”
Ghost of snitch is then overwhelmed by the power and is destroyed  in a flash of extreme power; the stone then reappears in Scientist’s hand.
Scientist: “Let that be a warning to the rest of you, none of you, except ryker, would be able to handle the stone's power, even if you do steal it and are not destroyed it will return to my hand after just a few seconds.” *pause* “The tape itself is not accessible even if you travel back in time. The film corrupted part way into recording. I was able to save some of the data before I was rudely killed. That data is stored in 3 parts. Part one is in my stone, part two is at the start of the stop, and part three… I am not actually sure where part three is. I lost track of it after it traveled using 6 dimensions.”
Nightfall
Radharc: “We have lost many of our systems. Is the backup reactor still working?”
Allen: “From what I can tell from the monitor, it is still stable but is not producing enough power to run the whole facility.”
Radharc: “Turn off the non essential elements, I am going to check the damage.” *Walks through sector 5 to outside*
Where the majority of night fall was is now just a large crater with the bottom so far down that it is not visible even to Radharc but is visible to Ryker
Radharc: “This is going to take so long to re-build.” *Walks back into sector 6* “Most of the complex was destroyed, part of sector 4 survived but that is it. Sector 1-4.5, 8-50 are all completely destroyed. I am going to move everyone back over to what remains of sector 4 so you can estimate the damage, follow me, and do not look, touch, smell, or anything in sector 5” *Walks back to sector 4* “What do you guys make of this?”
Jaeger: “Well, it is going to take a while to rebuild this, considering how large it was originally.”
Radharc: “Though I would like to bring you guys to a specific thing. Nightfall is only 10 stories tall,the explosion should have only destroyed all 10 stories. This crater is at least 2 miles deep. Which means…” *Pauses for a response.*
Jaeger: “Either the explosion was more powerful than you were expecting or, Scientist or another being destroyed more.”
Radharc: “Not exactly, this explosion revealed a shield portion of nightfall, the explosion only caused some minor damage to the first floor of the sealed portion. Though, it was enough to open up areas that even I didn't know existed.”
Jaeger: “Well, what dangers slash other things do you think we will find there?”
Radharc: “In all honesty, I knew ever since nightfall was ‘Built’ That the creators simply modified an already existing structure. So, I would suspect that this area could contain anything from old relics to literally nothing.”
Jaeger: “Let us hope that we can find some kind of relic to help us stop Scientist.”
Radharc: “Or the like 5 trillion wars that ryker started.”
Jaeger: “Yeah, that too.”
Ryker: *wanders up* “You want this fixed? I got you.” *reforms the entire Nightfall in 3.5 seconds* “Easy as summoning my Summer mansion.”
Radharc: “I appreciate the effort, but that is not the problem, I could have the physical building rebuilt in a few days. The problem is the aspect is missing. Scientist took it. Without the aspect, nightfall is pointless, the aspect is space, all of space come out from here.”
Ryker: “Aspect? Meh. That doesn’t matter, heres and aspect substitute:” *the label says: "I can't believe it’s not Aspect!”
They: * turns into ryker*
Radharc: “That is not really how that works, but thanks anyways.”
Ryker: “I am all powerful my friend. This substitute works.”
They: * in an exact replication of his voice* “ All powerful?
Radharc: “There is no being in the entire multiverse that could truly recreate it’s aspect, though, if I manage to destroy his stone.”
Ryker: “This substitute works.” *turns to fourth wall* “I can’t believe it’s not Aspect! Thank you Aspect Substitutes for sponsoring this video!”
Achevment: “Killing the dead 4th wall again”x5
Ryker: “Now, back to the video.”
Ryker then appears in BOUND because MAGIC
Scientist: “I think I may now know where the 3rd is”
Ryker: “First part please.”
Scientist: “Just give me 2 more days(Not speed up)” *Pauses* “The 3rd one is in the eternal library.”
Ryker: “Why is everything in the void library.”
Dream: * shrugs*
Scientist: “This is not the void library. It is much worse, to travel there you have to give up your powers while you are there, everyone has to, clones can not go either, they have to have a direct thought process.”
Ryker: *chuckles* “Clone! Go!”
They: “Clone! Go!”
Ryker: *looks at They* “Yeah, Clone, go.”
Dream: “ OHHH a mimic.” * thinks for a minute.* “ We need a ‘sack of rice’ if you catch my drift.”
Ryker: *nods* “I have one.” *looks at They again*
Dream: “ ohhhhhh.” * giggles.* 
Scientist: *Sneezes*
The entirety of Z2 is evaporated
Scientist: “Oops”
Ryker: “Why!”
Scientist: “It is your fault for making it dusty in here!”
Ryker: *looks around* “So. Will you guys help me regain control of SOUR?”
Meanwhile: Somewhere in Nightfall
Lazy Ryker: “Meta?”
Hyper Ryker: “Are you here Meta! Wanna play tag? Or ride bikes around the hall?”
Bob: *appears* “He just left. But I’m here.” *slurps smoothie*
Lazy Ryker: “Great. You’re with us.” *teleports them away*
Back to Scientist, Dream, & Ryker
Scientist: “I believe that if I could see part 2 and 3 I might be able to restore part 1.”*Checks watch* “50% charged, It should be ready very soon.”
Ryker: *checks backpack and sighs* “Here we go again.” *pauses* “Tapes please.”
Scientist: “Like I said get part 2 and 3 and I can try and fix it.”
Ryker: “Why can’t you get them.”
Scientist: “I can part 2, you have to get part 3.” *grabs part 2*
Ryker: “Where’s three again?”
Scientist: “The eternal library.”
Ryker: “Okay.” *pauses* “Here we go again.” *opens a portal and walks in, then strolls to the library*
The library is split into 5 sections each one labeled with knowledge, items, power, thoughts, and sight
Librarian: “You again. What do you want?”
Ryker: “Part 2 of the tape.”
Librarian: “Here you go”*Pulls it out of a shelf*
Ryker: *snatches it and leaves, and returns to Scientist.*
Scientist: “Good, now hand it to me”*Grabs it from him* “Now, give me a minute while I bring it back” *Begins to heal the tape it is clear that it is very difficult and complex*
Dream: “ huh, this feels too easy.” 
Scientist: “This is, strange, it has a like it was tampered with, you can play it, but something has clearly altered part of it”
Ryker: *plays tape*
The tape takes some time to play as if it is resistant. The tape begins with William back in the closet.
William: “ Hello it's me again. You've found all my tapes but one. This is my second to last one. Im talking about* lag* So let's get into it. * shaky breath.* the made * lag* i'm trying * lag* so they* lag* It*lag* afterward it can * lag* they used* lag* so thats how * lag* functions. This unfortunately is my last tape besides the 6th one because knowing them i'm going to * lag* one last thing. The man from the tapes nam* lag* 
*in the background alarms start going off.* 
William: “ turn it-” 
End of tape. 
Dream: “ told you. Too easy.”
Ryker: “So we need the first part.”
Scientist: “No, that was the only one that I rebuilt that was not broken. They have been tampered with. I could not tell how, but I have only seen this once before.”
Dream: “ oh yeah thats….crazy.”
Ryker: “So. What do I do? Is there some way to like…restore the tape?”
Scientist: “Maybe”
Dream: * almost too fast.* “ Nope! There's no way! I guess you should just give up.”
Scientist: “If only…” *Pauses* “There might, if-, no that is far too risky.”
Ryker: *checks something in backpack again* “No! Shut up!”
Dream: “ Yep we can't use it!” * bites lip.*  
Ryker: “All right. You two obviously aren’t telling me something.”
Scientist: “Dream, I know, but- ”
Dream: * looks down.* “ I don't know what you're talking about.”
Ryker: “Come on. If there’s a way, I’ll do it.”
Dream: * aggressively* “ you CAN'T! There's NO WAY, so just stop trying to meddle with things you don't understand!”
Scientist: “I do not think it would work anymore, but maybe. It would take time, lots of it.”
Ryker: “If you just give me a date and place, I can just do that instead.”
Scientist: “That will not work, there were spells so powerful that nothing in the multiverse could travel back to that time, not even you.”
Dream: “ Just STOP!” 
Ryker: “No. All I need is a date, and a time. If you can’t give it to me, I’ll find a different way.”
Dream: * lights on Fire.* 
Scientist: “Give me some time to think, I might have a way, it will just be, long” *Waves hand and dream is put out* “Sorry, the fire room is down the hall and on the right.”
Dream: “ You can't repair the tape!”
Ryker: “I can and I will.”
Dream: * tackles Ryker and possesses him.*
Scientist: “This will work, just give me some time and I can help you with all of your questions.”
Ryker: “Don’t you dare look in my-“
Dream: “ I'm not looking in your mind.” * possesses him.*
Scientist: “Ryker, do not, trust me. It will end bad” *Looks confused*
Dream: * as Ryker.* “ Why is it so noisy in here?”
Hestuia’s Hologram:  “It’s not Dream.”
Scientist: “Wait” *Begins to yell in the torivor language and the fake identity is removed from Dream* “Reveal yourself”
Dream: “ NO! I CAN'T LET HIM DO IT!!”
Scientist: *sits down and begins to chant a spell in torivor except it is understandable: “Beings of night and light undo yourself, become visible show yourself or fall”*
Hestuia’s Hologram: *becomes Corporeal and repairs tape* “Now it’s not his fault.” *pauses* “I knew that wouldn’t work.”
He can't. 
Dream: * lights on fire.*“ I'M DONE WITH THIS!” * goes back to reflections.*
Scientist: “You, I know you, stop trying to hide, should I make you show yourself, Edomic is very persuasive.”
Secret Ryker: *appears*
Ryker: *turns* “Oh hey!” *teleports to Reflections* “I’ll be back.” *pauses* “Dream? Are you there? I’m sorry.”
Dream: “ you’ve just entered dangerous waters,boy.”
Only Dream's powers work in reflections now. 
Ryker: “I’m not scared. You KNOW me.”
Dream: “ not scared are we? Then while you're here let’s have some fun!”
The black rocks from reflections grow around Ryker trapping him.
Ryker: *suddenly falls over and begins babbling idiotically*
Dream: * doesn't seem to care.* 
Ryker: *seems to not be able to move well*
Dream: “ should I kill you now? Or save the fun and bring more here? Scientist will soon see something’s wrong and come. And Rae, oh she’ll come. Cancer too maybe.”
You realize Ryker isn’t wearing his backpack
Dream: “ Hmm, is this what you need?“*holds up backpack.* 
Cancer:*can feel Dream doing things, completely blocks it out of her mind because it is interfering with her learning while sending a shockwave stunning them for a moment*
Ryker: *jolts head toward backpack, alarmed*
Dream: “ ok” * gives him backpack.* 
Ryker: *physically can’t grab it*
Dream: “ Shame you can’t get it?” * releases rock just long enough for Ryker to grab the backpack, then re restrains him.* 
A sudden laughing appears to be heard around the entire room.
Dream: * doesn't seem to notice.* “ So what do you think of my toy? Grand isn’t she. And to think she almost died like the others?” 
The laughing grows louder
Dream: * giggles.* “ She found you especially interesting. She knew one of your kind once.”
The laughing stops suddenly. A voice flickers on:
Ryker: *clears throat* “Well. If you’re hearing this, I’m probably dead. You defeated me. Congrats. Aren’t you proud of yourself? But, is it worth it?”
Inbetween
Cancer:*in inbetween*”oh [REDACTED]”
Prophet:”what?”
Cancer:”somethings happened to ryker”
Prophet:”that’s not good, it could affect the whole timeline”
Cancer:”then it will have to be fixed”
Prophet:”back to learning then”
Reflections
Dream: * giggles.* “What do I care if you're dead? I only care about keeping one thing alive here. My puppet.” 
Ryker: “I’m not dead though. But, also to the person who has won, feel free, since I’m betting you’re some sort of insanely powerful being, to use my body. It’s got a few tricks up its sleeves.” *a hologram of Ryker appears* “And, if by some miracle, you found my weakness, congrats. Goodbye all my friends, even you Wiziker.”*the recording flickers out*
Dream: * shudders and collapses.* 
Ryker is released. 
Ryker: “Welp, might as well continue being reckless.” *jumps into Dreams mind.*
Evelin is there. She looks like she’s concentrating on something. She is holding Dream who appears to be in an unrestful sleep. 
Evelin: * looks upset when she sees him.* “ Oh stars. Go! I can’t keep her under forever. And when they take her there’s not a whole lot I can do.” 
Ryker: “No. I’m ending this.” *looks at Dream* “What if I just…blast her.”
Evelin: “ You can’t. She’s only a representative of Dream. You can’t hurt or kill her.” 
Ryker: “What if I contain her.”
Evelin: “ you can’t do that either. To you she’s just an illusion. But if you can put us to sleep, we’ll stay under. Then you're cutting off their surveillance. We won’t be in the way either. Go find William. He can cut their connection off.”
Ryker: “The splitter ray? I can still save you.”
Evelin: “ you already tried that. It won’t work. They're still inside us. We need William. ” 
Ryker: “I WILL save you. Goodbye…for now.” *leaves mind and puts her asleep*
Dream: * starts thrashing at first but settles down.* 
Ryker: “But how do I find William?”
There is no answer because Dream is asleep. 
Ryker: *instinctively tries to summon Wiziker* “Wiziker I need to know-“ *pauses* “Oh. Right.” *he sighs* “Then I’ll do it manually.” *he searches his entire memories of everyone in the multiverse to figure out Williams last location*
He can’t find it. 
Ryker: “I need William.” *lines up all tapes together to see if he can see some to clue to Williams location*
Rae: “ RYKER!”
Ryker: *looks at Rae* “What Rae?” *distracted* “I’m a bit busy right now.” 
Rae: “ I had to make sure you were ok. I just felt like something was wrong.” * pauses.* “ What are you doing?” 
Ryker: “Searching for a man named William.”
Rae: * looks down.* “ a boy, not a man.” 
Ryker: “You know him?”
Rae: * nods.* “ He gave me one of his tapes. He told me to keep it safe because he wasn’t going to live long enough to keep it safe, himself.” 
Ryker: “Right. When and where was the last time you saw him.”
Rae: “ Time travel won’t work.” 
Ryker: “Why?”
Rae: “ spells. He put it on himself and his tapes.”
Ryker: “But do you still have an idea of where he would be?”
Rae: “ no”
Ryker: “So you’re of no help.” *looks around* “Where’d ya see him last?” *still searching for clues by lining up all the tapes*
Rae: “ I can still help.  Let me try something.” * sets the tapes up from 1 to 6 in a box shape.* “ Now try looking for clues.” 
Ryker: *looks for clues, observing edges of the tapes, and shining a black light etc*
When he shines the black light he sees symbols across each tape. 
Ryker: *looks at Rae* “D’y’know what these say?”
Rae: “ yup. Told ya I could help.” 
Ryker: *pauses* “So…what does it say?”
Rae: “ It's says tera.”
Ryker: “As in earth?” *pauses* “TeraDream? Dreamtera?”
Rae: “ no it sounds more like a place.”
Ryker: “Where though?”
Rae: “ I don't know.”
Inbetween
Prophet:”I have taught you most of what I can without you practicing more.”
Cancer:”okay… Well, then until we are completely done, you are going to help me.”
Prophet:”I do not wish to help you”
Cancer:”Well, you don’t have a choice.”
Prophet:*disagrees with this decision*
Cancer:”you, are going to listen to what I tell you, and right now, you are going to go and be my embassy in the physical realm.”*sends Prophet to the library in the physical realm.*”now, to find the atium that was stored by prophet, because he knew that this would happen”*begins flying around the inbetween to find it. Has to access Prophets memories in order to find where it is because she has never come into contact with atium before. She sends a black diamond raven to nightfall carrying a letter and some atium in a little jar. The bird travels through the Inbetween to get to nightfall and comes out and lands on Radharcs shoulder. She then begins to free some of the creatures and controlling them, she sets them to duplicating the atium.*
Back at the Library
Prophet:*sighs, is under the direct control of cancer, so he can’t do anything of his own free will.* ”I think that it means the dream scape, or like, inside dreams thoughts. Or maybe Reflections, because it's like Dream’s earth. Terra means earth by the way. ”
Rae: “ Maybe, I don't think so though.”
Prophet:”Then what do you think that it is then?”
Rae: “ i dont know.”
Ryker: *searches database of memories* “Welp. We’re screwed. Too many Terra’s to count.”
Rae: “ Are you sure we have all the tapes?” 
Ryker: “Well no. But he said that the last one was the last one so…”
Prophet:”well… something tells me that Scientist isn’t the most truthful of people.”
Rae: “ Did you check everywhere on the tapes?” 
Ryker: “I wasn’t talking about scientist.” *looks at Rae* “I guess not.” *checks all the tapes for clues* 
He finds more text.
Ryker: *reads text*
It’s in the same code as the other stuff.
Ryker: “Rae?”
Rae: “ It says T4.” 
Ryker: “Well that’s handy.” *opens a portal to T4* “To Terra!”
It seems to be blocked off. 
Ryker: “Well, is there a way to get there?” *pauses* “I mean we could try going through the doors.” *opens a portal to the doors, which has a door to every universe, and walks toward T4*
It's blocked off there too.
Ryker: “Any ideas?”
Prophet:”not really unless there are other ways, and we might be able to go in through the inbetween or reflections, but reflections is out, and you’re going to have a hard time convincing Cancer to let you through the inbetween.”
Ryker: “I doubt that would work.” *pauses* “I would try SOUR…but…”
Rae: “ Could you teleport him here?” 
Ryker: “I mean I could try…” *reaches out mind and spreads out brain to T4, looking for a william*
He can feel multiple people. But he can feel William. 
Ryker: *teleports small group of people around William with him included to here*
He appears to only be able to take one person. 
Ryker: *teleports William*
A boy falls into reflections. He looks to be Rae’s age. He looks like William but older. He’s unconscious. There are burn marks on his arms that are appearing from nowhere. He seems in pain. 
Ryker: *quickly attempts to heal him*
The healing works but the burns continue to appear 
Rae: “- William? Willam, are you ok?”
There is no response.
Ryker: “I’m trying my best here. Any burn treatment that would work better?” *continues healing*
Rae: “ no. We need to wake him up somehow.” 
Ryker: *smacks him hard* “Wake up.”
William: * does not respond.* 
Ryker: *puts some smelling salts under his nose, puts whipped cream on his hand, and tickles his nose, then puts his hand in warm water*
Rae: “ stop it.” * stops him.* “ Do you think going into his mind will help?” 
Ryker: *shrugs* “Okay.” *jumps into mind, leaving a small way open to let in Rae as well*
Rae: * stays behind.* 
Williams mindscape appears to be on fire. William in the center chained down. The fire is burning him everywhere but he doesn't seem to be able to do anything about it. He screams in agony. 
Ryker: *instinctively tries to put out fire*
He can’t. The chains keep him there. William doesn't seem to even notice Rykers there. 
Ryker: *calls out* “Hey! Can you hear me!”
William: * doesn’t respond.* 
Ryker: *yanks on chains*
The chains move but don’t break. 
Ryker: *attempts to put out fire with water he generates*
The fire doesn't go out. 
Ryker: *yanks on William, trying to break him free*
William: * is pulled forward but the chains don’t break.* 
Ryker: *moves some of the fire in an attempt to melt the chains*
The chains don’t melt.
Ryker: *annoyed, turns the chains to water*
He can’t. 
Ryker: *breaks the chains*
The chains seem to be like normal chains and break under pressure. As soon as they break Ryker is forced out of his mind. 
William: * stirs, winces from the pain and slowly gets up. The burns stop appearing.weakly * “ …who- wha- where?”
Rae: “ William?”
William: “ Rae? We’re are we? Why am I not dead? Who’s this kid?”
Ryker: “Your worst nightmare.”
William: * shakes his head.* “ How did you find me?”
Rae: “ your tapes.”
Ryker: *nods* “So…we need your help with Evelin.”
 William: “ What do you mean? She goes by Evelin now?” 
Ryker: “No. But…” *opens a portal to Dream*
William: “ Dream! What happened? Is she ok?!” 
Ryker: “Well yes, but actually no.”
They: “ Well yes but actually no?”
They: “speaking is really weird. It's just making sounds and hoping someone can recognise them and make different sounds back. At least i've         mastered it now”
William: “ That's not an answer. If i'm going to help i need to know whats wrong.’’
They: “dream and Evelin are different people now”
Prophet:”Hmm, well then how are they in the same body without things happening, actually, scratch that. Something is happening. How, are we going to get them apart? I think that that might work…”
They: “they have different bodies”
Prophet:”Well how do we separate their bodies?”
They: “that's already happened.”
William: “ Rae, will you please explain to me what is going on? Who are all these people? ”
Rae: “ We're trying to save Dream from them.”
William: “ uuhhh ok.”
Prophet:”I come from F13. Well, it’s not F13 anymore. You may call me Prophet”
They: “ I come from a different multiverse you can call me They”
William: “ ok, don't know why i needed to know that. So what do you want me to do again?” 
Prophet:”fix Dream, separate them, Idk, we just want you to fix them”
William: * sighs and turns to Ryker.* “ What do you want me to do again?”
They: “why are you looking at me. I didn't ask the question.”
Prophet:”You're looking like ryker right now, he lost which one of you is the real one.”
William: “ oh right. There are two of him.” 
They: “ points at Wizyker. He is the “real” one”  
Prophet;”no, he’s one of them but not the one you want to talk to”
They: “than its him” * points to L368*
William: * sighs.* “ Rae, which one is the real one?”
They: “Him” * points to a picture of Rae’s dad.*
William: * has been ignoring him.* 
They: “Them” * points at lazy ryker, mad ryker, crazy ryker, evil ryker, hyper ryker, heroic ryker, the multiversal gem*
Rae: “ All of the above.” 
They: “Him” *points at smokey joe*
Prophet:”Those are all him, except for smokey. I don’t know where he came from”
Ryker: “I’m me.”
They: “I can verify that he is him”
Prophet:”Well, aren’t they just different pretenses?”
William: * sighs.* “ ok i need to know, What the heck do you want me to do?!” 
Ryker: “I'd Know, I thought you’d know. Dream told me to get you.”
William: “ Did she say why and is this before or after she passed out”
Ryker: “Before.”
William: “ Well what was happening before it happened.” 
Prophet:”She was being all evil and controlling and trying to kill ryker before evelyn put her back to sleep”
They: “Why are there so many Rykers?”
Prophet:”Because he went nuts, or because of the gem. Either one, probably both, actually.”
Ryker: “Because I created a society of them. Duh.”
They: “But why”
Ryker: “Because I can only trust myself.” *pauses* “Or I could..”…”
They: “But why”
Ryker: “Because everyone else wants power for themselves, so do I, but we all share the fact that I want power.”        
They: “what use is power”
Jaeger: “Getting what you want, easily.”
They: “if you can't work for it what’s the point”
Ryker: “Power.”
They: “it's the journey not the destination.”
Jaeger: “Unless the journey is boring.”
Ryker: “That’s what people without a good destination say.”
They: “or people who have been everywhere and know better. Your still young enjoy it”
Ryker: “Young?” *chuckles* “I’m older than you.”
Jaeger: “You do realize I do not age due to my invulnerability, right?”
They: “ how do you know you're older than me?”
Author: “Meta speakingly, Jaeger is technically older than they because Jaeger was created first.”
THE Author: “But from a lore perspective Ryker is infinitely old.”
Author: “Yeah, that too.”

Author: “For those of you wondering, this roughly says ‘WE'RE NOT GOING OFF META’.”
THE Author: “Where. Where not going off meta.”
Author: “Yes, but I did not want to risk angering Him” The Editor: “Wise choice..”
They: “that young man can shut his trap, also I come from different lore so I am older than indefinitely”
Ryker: “...Different Lore. Are we doing a multi-multiverse?”
They: “larger than that.”
Ryker: *eyebrow raise*
They: “the multiverse to the multi- multiverse ect”
Ryker: “So the multi-multi-multiverse?”
They: “ infinitely further. What do you think the eternal being is? A “variant” from a different multiverse of me”
Ryker: *sighs* “Well why are you bugging my Multiverse?”
They: “ I just traveled down the chain for all eternity and happen to be the last link.”
Ryker: “Go back to where you came from. We don’t want you here.”
They: “can't go back”
Ryker: *sighs* “Great. Just leave me out of this.
They:  *sighs* “ Why are you so rude?”
Ryker: “Because you’re annoying.”
They: “ so you will insult an old man who lost his wife to get here”
Ryker: *nods* “I don’t care about your social life.”
They: *nods* “all Rykers are the same. Only care about themselves.”
Ryker: *nods* “That's the point.” *pauses* “We’re narcissists.”
They: “No, they're cruel and uncaring about others only killing for fun.”
Ryker: “Well I’m different. I’m sorry for being rude, I’m just busy.”
They: “ no you're not. You have infinite power and time.”
Ryker: “I am. I like being polite to the authors by not using all of my power.”
They: “ yes the people who could kill you with a thought. You wish to overpower them.”
Ryker: *shrugs* “Not really. I’m fine how I am right now.”
They: * looks surprised.* “ There is hope for you yet. Other Rykers just want to kill their authors. An undoable deed”
Ryker: *nods* “So you can go die in a hole.”
They: “ oh don't be so tart.”
Ryker: “You can go now.”
They: “i can't like i said”
Ryker: “You can go now.”

Lazy Ryker: “My next guess is that Meta is here.”
Bob: *slurps smoothie* “But why?”
Hyper Ryker: “BecauseHeIsReferencinglorefromtheoldonewherethiscraterwasoriginatedandhewasrecreated.”
Lazy Ryker: “Exactly.  META?”
Evil Ryker: “What Lazy?”
Lazy Ryker: “You’re coming with us. We’re reuniting the gang to beat up Wiziker.”
Evil Ryker: “Ah! Of course I’ll aid in his ‘beating up’”
Lazy Ryker: “Great. Just ignore Bob and Hyper, that’s not my fault.”
Bob: *slurps smoothie* “Meh.””
Lazy Ryker: “Let’s go.” *teleports them away*
Meanwhile 
William: * sighs because these people are frustrating.*
Rae: “ Welcome to my world.”
William: “ What do you mean by Evil? Dream isn’t evil so was it them or was she just acting out?”
Ryker: *clears throat* “Well I’m pretty sure it was Them due to the process of elimination.” *pauses* “And I apologize for this man.” *gestures toward They*
William: “ oh my… you could have started with that. I had no clue what you wanted me to do.” 
Ryker: *shrugs* “Sorry?”
Prophet:”yeah, he’s annoying and won’t go away. Dream wasn’t just acting up, she legitimately wanted to kill ryker and was enjoying it.”
Ryker: “I was faking it.”
Prophet:”Still, even though she didn’t actually kill you, she was enjoying wayyyyy too much for it to have just been acting up.”
William: “ I can cut off their connection, but the only downside is that she has to be awake.” 
Ryker: “Got it.” *wakes her up*
Rae: * before he can wake her up.* “ Wait! Maybe we should be smart about this. If she tried to kill you before then she’ll probably try it again. And this is her realm.”
Ryker: “We’ll just take her somewhere else first then.” *teleports the group to the void library*
Prophet:”I thought that she couldn’t leave Reflections. There might have been a reason for that, actually. We may be in for a surprise.”
William: “ It's the best plan we’ve got.”
Rae: “ I’ve got another idea.” * surrounds her in a circle of salt.* 
Ryker: *does so*
Dream: * wakes up. She looks really mad. She bangs on the barrier.* “ LET ME OUT!”
William: “ sheesh, what did you do to get on her bad side?” 
Dream: * looks in rage at William.* “ You traitor! How did you get out!” 
Ryker: *looks at William* “I found all your tapes. She got mad.”
William: * nods.* “ yup, that’s definitely them. You did the right thing bringing me here.”
Dream: “ TOUCH ME AND I'LL BURN YOU TO A CRISP!”
William: “ You don’t have to be such a drama queen.” * reaches in the circle and touches her forehead.*
Dream: * posture changes to a more relaxed one. She falls over, then gets up and looks around in confusion.* “ William? What happened?”
Ryker: “You went insane.”
Dream: “ I am insane. How did you not notice this?”
William: “ It's ok. I took their control away. The only downside is they probably know where we are and might send someone after us.”
Ryker: “Great!” *smiles* “That will be handy!”
William: “ no I mean they will send someone here to do their dirty work. They're not stupid enough to come here and face us.” 
Dream: “ uhhhh can you let me out please?” 
Ryker: “Speaking of them…When did Dream get experimented on and when?”
William: “ you just asked the same question twice and I’m not sure.”
Dream: “ uhhh guys.”
Ryker: “Sorry, I’m tired, where and when. And how do you NOT know?”
William: “ they didn’t let us know where the facility was. And we didn’t know the time either.”
Dream: “ guys?”
Ryker: “Should we?”
William: “ she’s not under control. Seems safe to me.”
Rae: “ sure.”
Ryker: *licks finger and eats salt*
Dream: “ thanks.” * goes through a portal to reflections then spears next to them.* 
William: * jumps back startled.* “ gees. that’s new.”
Dream: “ sorry.” 
Ryker: “D’y’know where they are?”
William: “ ye-“ * pauses and looks confused.* “ No actuality.” 
Ryker: “What was That?”
William: “ what?” 
Ryker: “You were about to say yes, but cut off and said no. Are you hiding something?”
William: “ Why would I hide anything from you?” 
Ryker: “Because you don’t trust me?”
William: “ but I trust Rae and I trust Dream. Look, you went through the work to find my tapes, you went through the work to find me. We’re on the same side. I don’t have any reason to hide anything from you.”
Ryker: “So can we get to them somehow?”
William: * fidgets with his purple vest.* “ maybe.” 
Ryker: “You obviously know something.”
William: “ if I knew something I would tell you. It’s actually the opposite.”
Ryker: “Explain the fidgeting.”
William: “ I’m nervous. I just got back and Dream’s been freaking out. Rae seems different, there’s all these new people and then I’m having trouble remembering things.” 
Ryker: “Great. Another person losing memories.”
William: “ I’m going to assume this happens a lot.”
Rae: “ it’s stupid how many times this has happened.” 
Ryker: *nods* “I guess we wait for another evil guy. I mean unless you want to help me take back SOUR.”
William: “ What's SOUR?”
Rae: “ it’s like his own dimension.”
William: “ this kid has his own dimension?! Why?” 
Ryker: “Kid? I’m older than you. Kinda. Ish. SOUR stands for Society of Universal Rykers.”
William: “ um ok.”
Dream: “ you don’t have to worry too much about gaining control. There are like 3 different Rykers with the same plan. Oh they have Bob with them too.”
Ryker: “Bob? The smoothie guy who died?”
Dream: “ yeah.”
William: “ wait! There are more people with you guys!”
Rae: “ yeah.”
Hestuia’s Hologram: *appears* “Oh hi William!”
William: “ uh hi.” 
Ryker: “That's Hestuia.”
William: “ hi Hestuia. How do you know my name?” 
Hestuia’s Hologram: “I can see the future. In fact this is all prerecorded.”
William: “ oh.”
Ryker: “So when’s the guy gonna show up so I can interrogate him?”
William: “ Well I was just assuming. They could just watch and wait.” 
Ryker: “So if I attempt to try and figure out more backstory will they come after us again?”
William: “ I don’t know. They probably won’t.” 
Ryker: “But you don’t know when the testing was?”
William: “no. Sorry.”
Dream: “ hmm that’s weird.”
Ryker: “So you wouldn’t mind if I went in your mind and messed with it.”
William: “ I’d prefer it if you didn’t.”
Dream: * looks confused.* 
Ryker: “That’s not a no!” *goes in Williams mind and tries to mess with his memories to return them to normal*
It fails
In the real world.
Dream: “ hey Eve? Do you remember anything about you know before we were-“ * in British accent.* “ you mean anything useful? No.”
Rae: “ what do you mean?”
Dream: * still in accent.* “ I can’t remember anything about them. Nothing important anyway.”
William: “ me neither.”
Ryker: “Nothing important? What do you remember?”
William: “ When did you get back?”
Ryker: “Three seconds ago.”
Evelin: “ Well I remember mum telling me she signed me up as a volunteer for a hospital. That was doing experiments for the new world as they called it.”
Ryker: “Where'd you live?” 
Evelin: “ We moved a lot. Also I wasn’t finished.”
Ryker: “Continue.”
Evelin: “ Thank you. Anyway I was picked up in a car and I fell asleep on the way there so I wasn’t Sure we’re we were. Then I started to go see some.. doctor I don’t remember his name or face though. Then something bad happened. I don’t recall what. But I trusted him. I don’t know why. Then I went to testing and then we were combined and then all I remember is what Dream remembers.” 
Ryker: “Well. Why were you at Terra, William?”
William: “ Terra T4? Oh because I saved Dream. And they found out I could break others' control.”
Ryker: “So? Were you banished or?”
William: “ Terra T4 is more like a torture chamber. In his- the man’s opinion, death is too good for traitors. He traps them in the prison of their own mind and then you’re put through things like burning and cutting.” * rolls up the sleeve of his golden shirt to reveal cut marks.* “ They don’t let you die though. In fact they make sure you don’t die. Only wish you were.”
Ryker: “And why couldn’t I go there?”
William: “ it’s blocked off.” 
Ryker: *sighs* “We have any other leads?”
William: “ I don’t know.”
Ryker: “No idea? Really?”
William: * nods.* 
Ryker: “Right.”
Prophet:”could lost objects be of any help? The Inbetween is full of things like that, the void too.”
Ryker: “I doubt it. William? Do you remember anything before Terra?”
William: “ struggling, a lot of struggling.”
Ryker: *waits* “Come on man, anything?”
William: “ he kept a tighter control on me than the others. And I get the feeling that I did stuff he didn’t want me to remember. Then my focus was on pretending to be loyal so he wouldn’t try and control me again, and secretly making the tapes and studying Dream.” 
Ryker: *sighs* “Okay.”
Who: “ HEY chicken face! Wait. I swear, there’s more of you every time I come here! You guys are multiplying like rabbits! So who’s the pretty boy?”
William: “ uhhh me?”
Who: “ yes you gorgeous. Du.” 
William: * is not sure how he should feel because he’s talking to a talking Bduck who is also flirting with him.* “ uuuhhh, I’m… William.”  
Who: “  Well William, I’m Who. The goddess of wealth and Minecraft spawning eggs.”
William: “ good for you I guess.” 
Ryker: “Oh great.”
Dream: “ what?”
Ryker: “Who.”
Prophet:”who, who, who. You're an owl who.”*giggles*
Scientist: “The experiment shall begin!” *Scientist teleports to z1* “Now, first things first.” *Lifts stone into the air and says: “MAY EARTH REIGN SUPREME”*
The Z universes begin to collapse 
Ryker: “WELL EXCUUUUUUSE ME, PRINCESS!” *teleports to Scientist* “No!”
Scientist: “Do not worry, this is only a test.” *The stone disappears.*
Ryker: “DON’T MESS WITH MY UNIVERSES!”
Scientist: “It is too late, nothing can stop what is coming.” *Scientist then disappears*
The rest of the Z universes collapse until there is only Z1, Z1 begins to change, then it is almost as if time has stagnated
Ryker: “No. I WILL STOP THIS…” *DUH DUH DUHDUDHDUDHDU*
In night fall
Radharc: *Begins to have seizure then it stops* “He has started, the Z universes have fallen, I can feel it.”
Crow on shoulder:”squaaaaaaaak”*there is note and a little bottle on its leg*
Radharc: “Grabs translator” *Grabs note and reads it*
It reads:
The little bottle attached to this bird contains a small amount of metal called atium. Atium allows the user to see a little bit into the future. You can try the small amount in the bottle as it works for everyone who has a power, but if you don’t, you are to destroy it. You are to destroy this message. We cannot allow Scientist to learn of this. You are to come to the Inbetween as soon as is convenient. I will meet you there. 
Back at Z1
Ryker: “You can’t delete the multiverse. It just keeps multiplying.”
A small message appears in Ryker’s hand.
You see, when there is no time, nothing can branch. Time is so flexible here, all it took was for me to realize, I can simply remove that aspect.
Ryker: “Well I’ll just jumpstart time.” *does so*
It fails to work
The message then reads, nothing can change here, one of the perks of eternity.
Ryker: *chuckles* “You think only you can change aspects…” *chuckles* “I CAN DO ANYTHING.”
The note then reads
No being can stop this, there is no one in all of the multiverse that can do that, not even the stone can undo this! It can only take!
Ryker: “No one! But the stone takes aspects. So it's quite simple. All I need to do is takes the aspects of the stone.”
 *does so*
The note changes
I am laughing, the stone is nothing more than a stone, it is simply a way for me to channel it, nothing can stop what is coming, Ryker, watch your back. The note then bursts into flames and the z universes nose is now eternal which means nothing can change in it
Ryker: “I will stop you. I can do ANYTHING.” *his face shifts, and his body reverts to Ryker* “We’re back Baby!” *Meta Ryker takes control*
In night fall
Radharc: “I know how we can stop him! I think.”
Prophet:*appears suddenly and violently*”I am to take you to the Inbetween. Will you allow me to?”
Ryker: “Hurry up and give me the plot hook.”
Radharc: “It is… (Is trying to say something)”
Radharc: “I need to go.” *Goes to In between*
Prophet:*vanishes*
Cancer:*in human form, behind him*”Come with me, I think I have a way to kill him”
Ryker: *appears* “I need my plot hook.”
Radharc: “Ryker, stop being meta, what is it?”
Ryker: “no.”
Cancer:”we are talking and Scientist is going to change Z1. Is that enough of a plot hook for you?”
Radharc: “How do you think we can stop him?”
Cancer:”Scientist is changing Z1”
Ryker: “Still not a plot hook.”
Cancer:”earwigs are called earwigs because they live in ears of corn.”
Radharc: “Yah, but what is your plan!”
Ryker: “To return it to normal. Duh. Do you are has stupid?”
Cancer:*sigh*”Ryker, really.”*changes back to original form, grabs Radharc and flys away with him*
Radharc: *Hits his forehead* “There is no Z connection to time anymore, it has completely left time”
Ryker: “You do realize ‘Z’ is just a general category. That means absolutely nothing.”
Radharc: “Yes, and no, the Z category is also the point at where it connects to the time aspect.”
Cancer:”okay…”
Cancer dives into a large hole, lands at the bottom, and puts Radharc down. There is a large stone colored crystalline shaped thing in the center.
Ryker: “Y’all aren’t useful.”
Radharc: “I liked lazy Ryker.”
Cancer:*agrees*”We are going to trap Scientist in a crystal where his being will slowly fade over time. It may take millions of years due to his torivorian nature, but he will fade away into nothingness. I just need your help to create a crystal of proper elements and formation in order to hold him. Will you help?”
Ryker: “Ya miss me? Great. I can create a crystal out of Pizzazium Infininte if you want.”
Radharc: “That would only kill him , though temporarily though, that gives me an idea, do you have a small shard of some of that crystal?”
Cancer:”No, I need your help to make it out of this”*puts hand on stone crystal*”you know the proper formulas and things”
Radharc: “I need you 2 to say this, I promise to not say the secret of time”
Cancer:”I promise to not say the secret of time”
Ryker: “I promise not to say the secret of time.”
Radharc: “Good, I know how to kill him, this crystal is exactly what I need, he is a paradox, all it takes is for me to build a small, contraption, once it is built, I just have to use it on him and he will stop, I had to skip lots of the plan, I am still under contract.”
Ryker: “Wait. Is this a paradox eliminator? I can’t go anywhere near those.”
Cancer:”then you may not be very useful at this time, you may just have to help distract him or something if it affects you.”
Radharc: “It will is not completely one, but this would kill you also.”
Cancer:”Hmm, so still dangerous even though it isn’t complete.”
Radharc:”First, I need something to change into that crystal, do any of you have some platinum or titanium bars?”
Cancer:*sends gem lizard to retrieve some*
Gem Lizard:*returns with large amount of platinum*
Radharc: “Okay, now, give me some time to study this gem” *Closes eyes and opens them again very fast* “Strange, I can see how to make it, but I have never seen an element like this, I don't even know how it bonds, well let's try this” *Taps cane on the ground*
The platelet rises up into the air and begins to all come together to form a small  dagger with a platinum handle.
Cancer:”hmm, this is reminiscent of the aluminum daggers of the fused.”
Radharc: “Do not touch the tip of this, I am not sure how it would react to this, it is strange, based on how I carve it.”
Cancer:”the daggers of the fused could suck in souls, this is where I got the idea, and the souls would dissipate over time”
Radharc: “This, will not have a chance to do that to scientist, this is the only material strong enough to harm him.” *Begins to feel something* “He is in A1, we need to get to him before he finishes.” *Opens door* “Do you want to come?”
Cancer:”yes, I would like to, but weren’t those super dangerous for non-eternal-ish beings?”
Ryker: “Oh [Redacted] no.” *teleports them all to A1*
Cancer:*is still a giant four winged dragon.*”Whatever, I think that Radharc was going to do it without Scientist knowing.”
Dream: “ about time you guys got here.”
Ryker: *punches Scientist in the face*
Cancer:”I don’t think that that helped anything, it might have made the situation worse, actually.”
Meanwhile in Rykers head
Lazy Ryker: *pushing Young Ryker* “No. You'll just have to wait your turn like the others.”
Young Ryker: “I want my OWN body.”
Bob: *slurps smoothie* “Nah, that’s overrated, then you’d actually have to do work.”
Young Ryker: “But I want my free choice!”
Hyper: *shakes head* “No! Cause then you wouldn’t be able to bounce around without people telling you to stop!”
Young Ryker: “Nope. I’m out of here. Y’all have fun dealing with SOUR. Ima deal with Scientist. Y’all have fun trying to be emperor.”
Back outside
Ryker: *grabs the splitter ray and shoots himself, splitting him into Young Ryker and “Emperor Ryker”*
Young Ryker: “You can go now.”
Emperor Ryker: “Oh we will.” *teleports to SOUR*
Young Ryker: *sighs* “This feels so much better. Great.” *slaps Scientist again*
Dream: “ yay violence.” * slaps Scientist as well.* 
Meanwhile…In Sour a bit later
Emperor Ryker: *pauses* “So I think we’ve destroyed the little rebellion for now.”
Wiziker: *gagged in a corner along with the other Wizikers*
Emperor Ryker: “Let me handle this.” *kills all other Wizikers except for Wiziker* “What should we do about him?” *pauses* “I say we let him off with a warning.” *pause* “He’ll do it again.” *pauses* “We have a jail.” *pauses* “Great. Let’s do that.” *strips Wiziker of his powers and puts him in SOUR prison* “Now about this throne room. I have an idea.” *he divides the room into 8 different segments, one for each core personality in a spiral, and replaces the throne, with a swivel chair throne* “Great. Each of us gets our own section of SOUR. Feel free to change it as you see fit. When we need to talk to someone, we’ll just have the person who’s area it is to handle it. I’m gonna give up main control now. No one go too overboard.” 
As subjects appear, Emperor Ryker manages their different concerns quite well and resolves all worries post Wiziker Reign.
Author Note: For ease of typing, Young Ryker will be shortened to Ryker and Emperor Ryker will be E Ryker.
Meanwhile 
Dream: “ Looks like we’ve solved our SOUR problem.” 
Ryker: *nods* “I knew they would.”
Dream: * turns.* “ Oh nothing much. I got to slug Scientist so that was a plus.” * pauses.* “ well yeah but if the four year old can then why can I?”
Ryker: “Who ya talking to?”
Dream: “ William and Rae. They’re here at reflections with me.”
Ryker: “Oh cool. Mind if I come?”
Dream: “ no, you can come.”
Ryker: “Cool.” *teleports to Reflections*
William: * jumps.* “ oh, hey.”
Rae: “ You punched Scientist?”
Dream: “ twice.”
Ryker: “Yeah! And thanks to the personalities, we can go to SOUR again.”
Rae: * nods.* “ uhhh ok.”
Ryker: “So. There’s Scientist who’s just standing still taking slaps. Anyone else want to slap him?”
Rae: “ … I’m good.”
William: “ Wait, you enjoy slapping people?”
Dream: “ yup.”
Ryker: *shrugs* “Sorta. Especially if they’re big bullies.”
William: “ yeah. I guess that’s true.”
Ryker: “I mean I’m not insane. I wouldn’t just randomly slap someone.” *pauses* “Or would I?” *smiles mischievously*
William: * prepares for Ryker to swing at him.*
Ryker: *smacks Rae* “Haha! That was funny!”
Rae: * grabs his hand mid smack.* “ Nice try.”
Ryker: *sighs disappointed* “I’ll do it when you least expect it!” *giggles* “Who are you anyway? I haven’t really gotten to know you.”
Rae: “ Who me?”
Ryker: *nods*
Rae: “ Well according to you, like a while ago, I’m your daughter.”
Ryker: *pauses and blinks* “What!?”
Dream: * laughs.* “ that was Rae’s reaction when she found out!”
Ryker: “But…?”
Rae: “ Well you're not my father but a variant of you is my father and you kinda slaughtered him when I was five years old.” 
Ryker: *blinks* “I’m…sorry?”
Rae: “ It's fine. I blame E Ryker more than I blame you.”
William: “ why are paradoxes always confusing?” 
Ryker: *shrugs* “I’m still sorry.”
Rae: “ it’s ok.”
Dream: “ oh my goodness. This is sooo awkward.” 
Ryker: “Okay then.” *clears throat* “So. I guess tapes?”
William: “ What about them?”
Ryker: “Are there more?”
William: “ unfortunately not.”
Ryker: “Is there any way to find them?”
William: “ find what?” 
Ryker: “The people that “made” Dream? I don’t know.”
William: “ how?”
Ryker: “I just want to find the other people in the tape. Is that so hard?”
William: “ yes. They've done a lot to keep their secrets.”
A mirror floats up and they can see Cancer’s face
Cancer:”Well, what can we do to uncover these secrets?”
Dream: “ no clue.”
Cancer:”That's why I’m asking. So that we have a clue, not no clue.”
They: * still looking exactly like ryker* “ well I'll let you kids figure it out I need a nap” 
William: “ Oh great, there are two of him again.”
Cancer:”really, we don’t need that, so if you don’t have any information you can leave”
They: *sighs and rubs his eyes*“have you checked their modern day Headquarters”
Cancer”I don’t think so, we shall have to look. Where is it?”
William: “ I don't know.”
Cancer:”how do you not know.”*sigh*
William: “ i don't remember.’’
A large tremor begins to shake the multiverse then the statue of scientist that you guys were slapping changes and the scientist appears
Scientist: “Good, you guys have made it for front row seats for The experiment!” *Begins to chuckle* “I know you are here to stop me. Do not worry, You will fall!”
Radharc: “Surrender now or you will die.”
Scientist: “You, I will be glad to watch you fall!”
Dream, Ryker, Jaeger, and Cancer need to be online to continue the story. Or at least, 3 of them.  
(intermission)
They: “young man why are you attacking such a beautiful world”
Scientist: “You will know soon…” *All of time is frozen*
They: “ why is that? Life is so beautiful it has ice cream. Do you like ice cream?”
Scientist: “I do not think you understand, I am eternal, I have seen all, and nothing. I have found life to be…”
They: “ evidently not”
Scientist: “Name one thing, I can promise that I have done it.”
Jaeger: “Stayed dead.”
Scientist: “Yes, I have, It will never change.”
They: “ you obviously didn't start “this eternal stuff” until about 4 millenia ago”
Scientist: “You are trying my patients. I would not recommend becoming on my dark side.”
They: “ true eternal beings are respective of all life. You're just a lost little boy”
Scientist: “I am afraid, I will give you one more chance…” *Looking slightly upset.*
They: “ if you cannot respect life you can't live up to your name”
Scientist: *Waves hand and They is sent into a strange mental state, He begins to see all yet nothing then he appears in a strange room that almost looks familiar.* “You have made a mistake”
They has entered the catacombs
They: *he isn’t there because one of his power is the ability to control the plane of existence he's on mental or not* 
Scientist: “I see”*Takes his power from him. He can not get it back* “Now” *Sends him there*
They: *is from a different multiverse making his powers not work like that*
Scientist: “No, matter, You will fall, you are fascinating, You have one of the few powers that I can not alter”
They: “ you speak like my superior”
Scientist: “I speak in a specific way…”
A large tremor begins to happen
They: *waves his hands and the tremor stops*
Scientist: “This place, makes me unsettled.” *Disappears temporarily*
Radharc: “He has entered that last stage, soon, he will destroy everything.”
A strange sound in the air begins it sounds almost like home
Radharc: “PLUG YOUR EARS, He IS TRYING TO CLEAR THE AREA”
Then it grows even louder, then it stops
They: *stands un affected.* “ you'll have to speak up”
Radharc: “He is coming, with the stone this time.”
All of the power seems to go out from everything to a small point then Scientist app
They: “oh you mean this?” * pulls out a different multiversal gem*
Scientist: “Now, Lets BEGIN!” *Pulls out stone* “MAY EARTH REIGN SUPREME!”
A strange ripple happens in the multiverse
They: * rips the stone from scientists hands* “ … and number infinity. I have them all”
The stone disappears from his hand
Scientist: “YOU FOOL! THAT WAS JUST A STONE! NOW MY CURSE HAS BEGAN! NOTHING CAN STOP WHAT IS COMEING”
Radharc: *Begins to scream louder than ever*
They: “ I beg to differ” *pulls out the real stone and places it to the one from the other universe where they fuse. He pulled out infinite stones and connects them but they don't take up any more space*
Radharc: “You…. Wi..ll….lo..s..e…….” *Begins to fade*
Scientist: “I have won, there is nothing…” *Looks at leg*
Scientist has the knife of paradox in his leg
They: *holding stone* “you've been a bad boy and need to be punished”
Scientist: “No, No, Nooooooooooo.o.o..o…..oo…o..ooo” 
A tape and a contract appear in the air and they begin to burn, except it is actually destroying them
Scientist: “Wh…at…….have you done!...... I…….w………….” *Instead of blood, words begin to fall out of him, they are all of the things that describe him* “Nooooooooooooooo”
As scientist begins to fall, he looks, pale then begins to say his final words
Scientist: “In a world, a power began and will fall, Beings of the day and night be warned, Time has, does not heal all! Mr. Moonlark will RETURN! Namin will die” *Scientist falls over then disappears.* 
They: “ im sorry but you left me no choice” * turns towards Radharc* “ Joke, please help me. * he appears to have ages 100 years looking like a 75 year old when he looked like a younger 75 year old before*
Radharc: *Begins to look a little better* “There is still time left. Oh no.”
Once there is nothing left of scientist , all of his spells that he has performed (Except for what he did with the stone) begin to undo themselves.
Radharc: *Faintly speaking* “His spells, they are unweaving.”*Closes his eyes* “Except one, that stone, he did not cast those spells, but why and how. That stone was only a-a conduit. It did nothing more then let him cast them” *Coughs then he realizes something* “sour, they are collapsing,” *Opens eyes* “I do not…”*coughs even harder*
They: “ jake that is a problem for another day, please stop and have peace”
Radharc: “i am not dead, yet, he only managed to bring A-J and Z into eternity”
They: “ who said you were dead”
Radharc: “I am not dead yet. There are still some places with time. Including here”
They: “ you need a nap”
E Ryker: *chuckles* “SOUR isn’t collapsing. It isn’t just linked to A1. There’s a link to it from every universe with a Ryker.” *he shifts the main push point to an undisclosed location* “He’s not getting rid of us that easily.”
Ryker: *looks at E Ryker* “So. How’s SOUR?”
E Ryker: “Itsallright,lazyletusallhaveequalopportunitytocontrolthebody. Oh shut up. You’re always so annoying Hyper. We’re doing fine. Don’t worry. We’ll find a way to fix A-J and Z. Yeah, we’ve got this man, not even an author can stop us.” *slurps smoothie* “I mean technically they can, but we’ll be the ones to fix it eventually, ARRRRGH!”
Ryker: “Wow. That made my head hurt.”
Dream: “ Really? It made perfect sense to me.” * shifts. In British accent * “ That's because there are two of us here.”* shifts.* “ yeah but he has more voices in his head.” * shifts.* “ I’m not just a voice in your head.”
Ryker: “My mind is actually pretty clear now. E Ryker is the one with voices in his head.”
Dream: “ lucky.”
Ryker: *smiles gleefully* “Yeah, for once I can understand the voice in my head.”
Dream: “ You're still Lucky.” 
Ryker: “I didn’t say I wasn’t. But sometimes voices in your head can be beneficial.”
Dream: * British accent.* “ told you.” 
Ryker: “Anyways, since the Scientist stuff is over, I’m kinda hoping something happens with you guys now. Or just something to happen.” *bored, he decides to play some games on his phone*
Dream: * begins rummaging through the stuff in reflections.*
Ryker: *suddenly disappears, and the phone clatters on the floor*
Dream: “ again?” * swipes his phone.* 
The phone is on, running a game called “Temple Run”
Dream: “ Wait, so Ryker’s in the game.”
Rae: “ lol”
You do not see Ryker anywhere in the game.
Dream: “ Never mind.”
Rae: “ dang it.”
Dream: “ what are you STILL bitter that Ryker trapped you in the ‘ Stanley Parables’?”
William: “ Wait, what?”
E Ryker: “I have a guess on what happened to him.”
Dream: “ what?” * changes Rykers pass code to his phone.*
E Ryker: “We can’t tell them.” *pauses* “We should.”
Dream: “ Well imma keep being evil until you debate about this.” * buys a ton of random useless apps on Rykers phone.*
E Ryker: “We’ll tell you to advance the plot.” *pauses* “He’s in his actual location most likely, which I’m assuming is in his mansion somewhere.”
Dream: “ uhh ok.” * looks for it in reflections.*
In A1 she sees a  mansion floating above a small hotel
Dream: * goes in.* 
The area is more spacious internally, but you hear some ruckus from a room on the first floor
Dream: * goes back to reflections.* “ Cool, alright we need a sack of rice.”
E Ryker: “Why?”
Dream: “ I dunno.”
E Ryker: “So..who wants to go to Ryker…and investigate.”
Dream: “ I might go back.”
E Ryker: “So are we just leaving Ryker…”
Dream: “ no.”
Rae: “ depends on what's at risk.”
E Ryker: “How am I supposed to know?”
Rae: “ I don't.”
E Ryker: “I think y'all should go. I’m giving a plot hook.”
Cancer:*her mirror*”Well why should I leave.”
Dream: “ fine.” * goes back to mansion.*
High pitched screaming can be heard from the same room
Cancer:*appears in hall and takes up most of the hall. Shifts to human form and begins to investigate.* 
Dream: * does the same.*
When Cancer appears in the hallway, a ghostly message appears as well.
“Be it known to all who enter this domain, that those who enter may not use their powers while within”
Cancer:”where are you?”
Dream: “ here.”
Silence
Dream: “ RYKER?!”
Cancer:”RYKER?!!!”
Still Silent
Cancer:*begins wandering to where she thought she heard screaming*
Dream: * follows.*
Cancer:”do you know where he is?”
Dream: “ nope.”
They arrive at a painting in the front hall with a staircase going up. The painting is of Ryker
Cancer:”he seems to be a little vain. Just a bit"
Dream: * touches painting.*
It moves, and a door appears
Cancer:*goes through the door wearily.”
There seems to be a hidden room, with a small monitor and a chair. Crying can be heard from the closet
Cancer:*goes to the closet and opens it*
There is a baby lying there crying.
Cancer:*picks up child and goes over to the monitor to see what's on it.*
It is black.
Cancer:*looks for an on switch and turns it on*
It boots up, and a view of E Ryker can be seen.
Cancer:*begins looking for a microphone and camera on the computer*
There is one of each along with some form of scanner to simulate the actual environment
Cancer:*turns them on in order to talk to E Ryker*
E Ryker: “Hi Cancer. You found his console. Anything else?”
Cancer:”Who's this little child? I would guess Ryker, but you guys like to throw curve balls.”
E Ryker: *looks at the child* “Probably. That's probably his own fault. Oh well.”
Cancer:”what did he do?”
E Ryker: “Classified.”
Cancer:*sigh.*”you aren’t being of much help my friend.”*turns off computers and things and begins looking for an exit.*
She finds the exit immediately as she turns around.
Cancer:”hmm. There wasn’t an exit here before. Strange, of course ryker’s mansion changes.”*exits and goes to the Inbetween.*
Inbetween
Cancer:”hmm.”*changes to first form and takes the small child to the abyss*”Here is where you are going to stay while I find a better place for you and who you are. For now though, you are Ryker.”*makes a house out of the ground that is surrounded by a mist. Takes Ryker inside and puts him in a crib in the house. She sets a gem monkey to take care of him.*
The Child: *sobs in fear*
Cancer:”what”*sighs.*”Do you not want to leave me? Or are you just scared.”
The Child: *continues sobbing*
Cancer:*picks up child*
The Child: *stops crying, begins sniffling*
Cancer:*is annoyed*”REALLY?! Really.”*sighs*”So I have to carry your butt around everywhere.”*sighs*”annoying”
The Child: *cries*
Cancer:”what.”*sighs. Gives child pats*
The Child: *calm, sleepy*
Cancer:”goodnight”*gently lays Child down in the crib after he falls asleep.*
The Child: *wakes up 5 seconds later and begins to cry*
Cancer:*continues giving pats*
The Child: *calms down slightly*
Cancer:”what do you want?”
The Child: *giggles*
Cancer:*makes a translator*”kay, what do you want?”
The Child: *giggles*
Cancer:”haha very funny.”*continues giving much pats*
The Child *giggles happily*
Cancer:*has monkey play peek a boo*
The Child: *cries*
Cancer:*makes the monkey go away.*
The Child: *still concerned*
Cancer:*takes child out of the inbetween and into a green field full of bright yellow dandelions*
Dream: * turns invisible, and picks a dandelion and tickles the child with it.*
Cancer:*gives stink eye in dreams direction*
The Child: *giggles and reaches toward the dandelion*
Dream: * gives it to him, then grabs 8 more and makes them dance in a sort of circle around him, spinning and bobbing.*
Cancer:*continues giving stink eye at dream*
The Child: *claps in enjoyment*
Dream: * continues show for the child adding more dandelions.* 
The Child: *eventually gets sick of it and os uninterested*
Dream: * puts the flowers down and picks the child up so it looks like he’s floating.* 
The Child: *starts crying, worried*
Dream: * gently rocks him.* 
The Child: *begins to calm down slightly*
Dream: *soothingly.*“ It's ok.” 
The Child: *looks for origin of the voice*
Dream: * makes herself visible to only him.* 
The Child: *smiles*
Dream: “ Do you want to come with me?”  
The Child: *giggles happily*
Dream: “ I’ll take that as a yes.” * takes the child to reflections.*
Rae: “ where did you get that child?”
Dream: “ cancer and E Ryker think he’s Ryker.”
William: “ what?”
Rae: “ believe it or not this isn’t the first time this has happened.”  
The child: *looks at Rae*
Rae: “ hi.” 
The Child: *babbles incoherently*
Rae: “ So what do we do now?”
Dream: * shrugs and puts him down.*
The Child: *begins crying*
Rae: * picks him up.* “ don’t cry.”
The Child: *smiles and begins babbling quite a bit*
Rae: “ uhhh ok.”
The Child: *babbles more, points at Dream, babbles then giggles*
Dream: “ What about me?”
The Child: *Looks at E Ryker and babbles at him questioningly*
E Ryker: “Well. I'm going to go…so…” *teleports away*
The Child: *looks at William and cries*
William: “ I’m sorry. What did I do?” 
Rae: “ it’s ok. That’s just William.”
The Child: *Looks at Rae and calms down, then looks at William, and hides from him by covering his eyes*
Rae: “ It's ok. He’s nice.”
William: * holds his hands out and backs away.* 
The Child: *glares at William, then growls*
William: “ I’m sorry. I’m sorry.”
The Child: *continues to growl, looking at William without blinking*
William: “ geez. I’m sorry. I’ll leave if that’s what you want.”
The Child: *giggles at Williams' fear.*
Dream: “ wow this man does not fear an organization that has the ability to kill and torture him but a baby scares him.”
William: “ I’m not really scared. He just didn’t seem to like me.” 
The Child: *Looks at Rae, babbles, looks at Dream, babbles, then looks at William. Not blinking*
William: * just stands there. He doesn't seem to notice.*
The Child: *begins to cry*
Hestuia: *appears* “Yeah, nothing was happening over there, so I came here. How’s the kid?”
The Child: *Looks at Hestuia in fascination*
Hestuia: “Where’s Ry…oh right.” *looks at the child*
The Child: *sneezes*
Hestuia: *checks watch, and laughs* “Oh you haven’t realized…Good luck!” *disappears*
Rae: “ Oh no.”
The Child: *laughs at Rae*
Rae: “ I’ve got to go. Who wants him?”
The Child: *clings to Rae*
Rae: “ whoa. It’s time to let go now.” 
The Child: *grabs tighter*
Rae: “ oww. Look, you gotta let go.” 
The Child: *refuses to let go. It’s grip is quite strong*
Rae: * makes it so everything passes through her.*
Dream: * catches the child before he falls.*
The Child: *begins sobbing quite loud*
Rae: “ I’m sorry I’ll be back soon.” * teleports To Cancer.* 
The Child: *continues to cry*
Meanwhile
Rae: * looks around. She looks pale.* “ oh geez.” 
E Ryker: *appears* “What?”
Rae: “ I feel kinda nauseous.”
Dream: “ oh yeah. That's because you’ve spent more than an hour in between dimensions. Your body isn’t used to the time differences or actually existing.”
E Ryker: “Time anomalies can be annoying.”
Rae: * grabs her head.* “ mhmm.” 
E Ryker: *hands her a chocolate bar* “This should help.”
Rae: “ No. Thank you. I don’t eat sugar.”
E Ryker: “It doesn’t have sugar.”
Rae: * still isn’t convinced.* “ … really?” 
E Ryker: “Fine I’ll make it a salad.” *the bar disappears and a salad appears*
Rae: “ I’m good.” 
E Ryker: *shrugs* “Your choice.” *he checks his watch* “I…need to go.” *he vanishes*
They: * reaches through thin air catching E Ryker and sets him down at a table* “go where young man”
Doesn’t work


Meanwhile…
The Child: *still sobbing*
Dream: “ Come on. Please stop.”
Who: * appears.* “ HE- Wait, where’s chicken face?”
The Child: *continues crying*
William: “ Where's Rae?” 
Dream: “ I dunno.”
The Child: *Grabs Dream tightly*
Dream: “ yes?” 
The Child: *stares at her, deeply babbling seriously*
Dream: “ child I can’t understand you.” 
The Child: *nods seriously*
Dream: “ Ok then you do realize I’ve got no idea what you want right?” 
The Child: *giggles*
Dream: “ ok.“ * starts to put him down.*
The Child: *clings to her tighter*
Dream: * giggles and gives him an insane look.*
The Child: *happy and smiles, then grabs tighter*
Dream: * begins to lean forward.*
The Child: *climbs on Dreams back*
Dream: * begins floating on her back.* 
The Child: *has a VERY tight grip, refuses to let go*
Dream: * rocks gently.*
William: “ Be careful.” 
Dream: * grins.* 
The Child: *begins to calm down*
Dream: * begins swinging back and forth hardly.*
The Child: *giggles gleefully*
They: * grabs the baby away from Dream before she can hurl it.* “ whoops don't do that”
The Child: *begins to cry*
Jaeger: “Come on, the kid was having fun.” *Takes it back*
The Child: *giggles at Jaeger*
Jaeger: *Gives child back to Dream*
Dream: * continues swinging while floating.*
The Child: *giggles happily*
Dream: * goes faster.*
They: “ fine but if he gets hurt i will be forced to punish you”
Dream: “ Then I'll punish you back.”
The Child: *squeals with joy*
They: * looks at her questioningly* “ That's like punishing your parents. You can't do it.”
Dream: “ What parents?”  
They: “it's a simile”
Dream: “ Well, here I am the parents.”
Meanwhile…in Ryker Executive’s Ageless League of the Multiverse2 (REALM)
Ryker: *blinded* “Hello? Who?”
???: “We’ve been expecting you.”
????: “It’s been a while since an anomaly like this has happened.”
E Ryker: “Indeed.”
Back to the child
The Child: *giggles at the fight*
Jaeger: *Moves child away a little bit just in case.*
The Child: *clings to Jaeger*
Dream: * laughs suddenly.* “ Oh my goodness, I knew it.” * looks at the child and laughs harder. * 
The Child: *Looks at Dream, confused*
Dream: * looks the child in the eyes and mutters something to him.*
William: “ what?”
The Child: *giggles*
Dream: “ So who are you really?”
William: “ huu?!”
Dream: “ I wasn’t talking to you.”
The Child: *giggles*
Hestuia: *appears, chuckles* “Well it’s quite simple…it’s another Rae!”
Dream: “ ohh that makes sense.”
The child: * giggles.*
Dream: * looks at something* “ Oh Rae!”
Hestuia: *chuckles*
Meanwhile 
Rae: “ finally done.” 
Dream: “ hey Rae. We found out who the baby is.”
Rae: “ …who?”
Dream: * giggles.* “ you.”
Rae: “ good grief. I’ve got an idea. Give her to me.”
Dream: * brings Rae the child.*
The Child: * babbles.* 
Rae: “ ok.” * teleports away for a few minutes. Then comes back without the child.*
Dream: “ where’d you go?”
Rae: “ started a paradox,”
Dream: “ Does that make you a paradox too?”
Rae: “ I guess.” 
Achievement Got: “Your first (and technically last because a Paradox loops) Paradox”
Realm
Ryker: “Where am I?”
E Ryker: “An area outside of the known Multiverse.”
???: “Please withhold more information of our location before we complete the judging.”
E Ryker: “Of course, Your Honor. As to the case, I declare my client not guilty.”
Judge: “And the accusations against him?”
???: “Free Power Use Without REALM permit.”
Judge: “Prepare your witnesses and return at 0800 hours. The accused may roam around the area, with the limiter attached at all times.”
0800 hours
E Ryker: “The defense calls the accused to the stand.”
Ryker: *still blinded* “What is going on!”
E Ryker: “Did you or did you not obtain the multiversal gem?”
Ryker: “That’s a difficult question. As the core personality of Ryker, I can say that, yes, indeed I DID obtain the Multiversal gem.”
E Ryker: “And that resulted in you being converted into the form you are today, correct?”
Ryker: “Yes.”
E Ryker: “And I am the result of the other personalities congregating. No further questions, your honor.”
Judge: “The Offense may now question.”
???: “What is your name?”
E Ryker: “Objection! No relation to the accusation.”
Judge: “I want to see where he’s going with this.”
???: “Answer the question.”
Ryker: *clears throat* “I go by many names, mainly Ryker, Aiolos, or…” *mutters*
???: “What was That?”
Ryker: *mutters*
???: “Please speak louder for the jury.”
Ryker: “Rusulka.”
???: “And, may I ask, when was the last time your base personality was in control.”
Ryker: “I would say during my combination of Rimisile.”
???: “Let the Jury note that Rimisile was a formation between this Ryker, Smile, and Mimick, from Multiverse designation XL-23.”
Ryker: *nods* 
???: “So, in fact, your personality that is in control currently has not been a dominant force for the past 10 years.”
Ryker: “Yes.”
???: “Let the jury note, that, this Ryker has no relation to the one who obtained the permit in the first place.”
E Ryker: “But, your honor, Ryker is, in fact, a portion of the person who bought the same permit.”
Judge: “Closing Statements please.”
E Ryker: “Your honor, my client obtained the accurate permit required for the use of unobstructed powers.”
???: “May the jury remember footnote A-32 subsection B of the 139th amendment to the Law Restricting Powers: A man split must be in his right mind for the purchase to pertain to the certificate. If this is the case, This ‘Ryker’ is, in fact, not in the right mind the certificate requires.”
Judge: “The jury will converse, and determine the guilt of the accused. There will be a recess of 20 minutes.”
Post 20 minute recess
Jury: “We find the accused guilty of Free Power Use Without REALM permit.”
E Ryker: “Sentence?”
Judge: “3 millennia with limited use of powers. He may retain 4 of his choice (with limitation), and may NOT request aid from other members of the Society relating to the multiverse from SOUR. Emperor Ryker will be his protector. Case dismissed.”
Suddenly Ryker is warped to an unusual room, void of material
Ryker: “What just happened?”
E Ryker: *ethereal voice* “You may pick your powers.”
The rest of this discussion is [REDACTED] for later use
Ryker: *is suddenly sent to exactly where he was kidnapped*
E Ryker: *returns to SOUR*
Dream: “ well we’ll well. You really gave us a heart attack kid.”
Ryker: “I did? What did ya think happened? I was…busy.”
Dream: “ I was watching. You went to court. Man you are only 4 years old and you went before me. Lucky.”
Ryker: “I have NO idea what you’re talking about.” *glares at her*
Dream: “ what?”
Ryker: *glares*
Dream: “ geez sorry.”
Ryker: “Thanks for that.”
Dream: “ for what?”
Ryker: *looks back and forth* “No one should know about…*whispers* the court case.”
Dream: “ oh ok. Noted.”
Ryker: “Also, what happened to the baby in my closet?”
Dream: “ We stole it to make a paradox.”
Ryker: *sarcastic* “Great.”
Dream: “ Blame Cancer. She was the one who took her.”
Ryker: *annoyed* “Now I just have to get another.” *he vanishes, then reappears* “Great. Done.”
Dream: “ should i be concerned?”
Ryker: “no.”
They: “okay”
Dream: “ ok. But don't be surprised if Rae gets upset.” 
Ryker: “Why would she know?”
Dream: “ because I'm going to tell her.”
They: “ okay “
Ryker: “I just want a friend!”
Dream: “ That hurts.” 
They: “ stop that young man. Don't mutter”
Cancer:*appears*”kay, don’t blame me for the fact that Ryker's keeping a baby in his closet, put it in a better place and then I might not steal it.”
Suddenly a section of the room darkens to make a blank void off to the side. A giant sock monkey appears sitting in the void. 
Dream: “ MINE!!!!!!!!!!!!” * runs up and hugs the sock monkey.*
Cancer:”really, monkehe. Ooh ooh ah ah. It is now a race.”*changes and runs to it as well.*
The sock monkey is very hard
Dream: “ aw i wanted a giant sock monkey.” 
Simon; *comes out of the sock monkey* “Dude, it's a building. It's made of wood.”
Cancer:”okay… and? We can hug buildings if we want. And who were you again?”
Simon: “I am the unwanted being. I wander the universe looking for magic.
They: “ you are wrong you are wanted by at least one person”
Cancer:”and your name is?”
Dream: “ oh yes i remember you. The guy with the parrot.”
Simon: “I’m Simon. I have started this multiversal shop. It's a giant wooden sock monkey.” 
Dream: “ Do you sell sock monkeys?”
Cancer:”if soo, I would like one.”
Simon: “No. My wares are randomly gathered from the multiverse. Every one of my items are permeated with magic.”
Dream: “ You're dead to me.” 
Cancer:”I have no care for any of this. I can make many magic items.”
Simon: “I could call a sock monkey from the multiverse.”
Dream: “ yay! I need one.” 
Cancer:”I don't need a multiversal sock monkey to take over my mind.” 
Dream: “ Bu- i- soc- i kne-” * begins hyperventilating.* 
Simon: “aY lliW gnihtemos yub”
Dream: “ yeknom kcos.”
They: “ stop muttering and speak proper”
Dream: “ REVEN!!!!!”
Cancer:”I don’t wish to learn how to speak backwards.”
Dream: “ ton yhw?”
Cancer:”because, and now I already am.”*sigh*
Dream: “ aedi na tog ev’i.” * goes to reflections.* 
Cancer:”okay, good bye”*goes to the inbetween and lets Rae in*
In the Inbetween
Cancer:”What do you want?”
Rae: “ me? Nothing.”
Cancer:”Then why are you here?”
Rae: “ because you brought me here.”
Simon: “Sorry I accidentally got sucked into the void again. It happens. Now. gnihtemos yub!”
Cancer:”this isn’t the void. Go away”*shoves him out of the inbetween*
William: *steps out of a portal from reflections.* “ oh uhh hey guys. Where are we?”
Cancer:*glares*”This is why I think that I have decided to block off the Inbetween permanently.”*sigh*”you are in the inbetween. My domain. Now, unless you have business here, you may leave”
William: “ Does everyone have their own dimension?”
Simon: “Literally I keep asking you to buy something but I guess you don’t speak backwards. Do you want to buy a ‘magic fish tank?’ Or maybe a ‘jar of time juice?’”
William: “ uhh no. who are you?” 
Cancer:”because I made it mine. You can make one yours if you wish. NO. I do not need a magic fish tank or any of your other wares. He is Simon, the unwanted.”
Ryker: “I kinda have my own dimension…SOUR is all of the Rykers tho.””
Rae: “ I don't.”
William: “ uhhh ok.” 
Cancer:*sigh*”ya know, Dreams been ALONE for the past ten years ish and i don’t think that she does well alone for long periods of time. So go pay her a visit and leave if you don't want me to make you leave”
William: “ uhh i don't think she will let me back in. she just came in, said she wanted to be alone, opened the portal to here, and pushed me through.”
Cancer:*sigh*”I will have to do something then. She is planning something.”*changes in abyss dragon. Is very big.*
Simon: *sigh* "I'm unwanted in every universe"
William: “ I know how that feels.”
Cancer:”how do you even do that?”
William: “ do what?”
Cancer:”become unwanted everywhere”
Simon: "I guess I don't log on enough"
Fourth Wall:*bone cracking, dead*
At SOUR
Jaeger: “So, Ryker, why did you disappear this time?”
Ryker: “Um. Yes.”
Jaeger: “ I see.”
Ryker: “I’d prefer not to talk about it.”
Jaeger: “Alright then, what do you want to do?”
Ryker: “Currently, I want to do some time travel shenanigans.”
Jaeger: “Concerning whom?”
Ryker: “Dream.”
Jaeger: “Good idea, may I join you?”
Ryker: “One problem. I can’t seem to do any shenanigans, cause I can’t time travel then. See.” *tries*
Jaeger: “Why not?”
Ryker: *shrugs* “Dream? Ya know anyway to get the people to come here? I’d prefer to be able to go do some time travel shenanigans, obviously I’m not gonna bring an alternate version of you back though, that’s played out.”
Dream: * apparears.* “ no. I’m busy right now.”
Ryker: “Doing what? The world isn’t ending.”
Dream: * pauses.* “ uhhhh… something. That’s… not important.” 
Ryker: “Tell me…”
Dream: “ no.”
Ryker: “Please?”
Dream: “ no”
Ryker: “Can I Come?”
Dream: “ I want to be alone.”
Ryker: “But I’m bored.”
Dream: “ Bold of you to assume I’m doing something interesting.”
Ryker: “You’re doing something.”
Dream: “ So are you.”
Ryker: *sighs* “Fine.” *sits there, waiting for Dream to leave*
Dream: * turns around and looks confused and concerned.* “ he-“ * disappears.*
Ryker: *uses back door to enter reflections*
He can go in. Dream isn’t there.
Ryker: “Great.” *looks for clues*
He doesn't find anything. 
Ryker: *frustrated* “If I were…” *attempts to rewind time a bit to see what happened*
Time doesn't exist in reflections.
Ryker: *attempts to contact Dream through Reflections*
He can’t find her.
Ryker: *shouts* “No! Nononono No!”
…the story doesn't know what to make of this. Like what was he attempting to accomplish?
Ryker: *laughs at green text* “I have no idea. What do you suggest?” *shuffles around, looking for hints about her whereabouts* 
There is nothing. Also who are you asking?!
Ryker: “You green text. Who else?”
..I’m not supposed to talk to you.
Ryker: “Well you are.”
What do you want from me?! What do you think you're going to get me to tell you where Dream is?!
Ryker: “Yes.” *pauses* “Will you?”
No. I can’t. 
Ryker: “Can you give me a hint?”
No! You can’t make me say anything!
Ryker: “Fine.” *checks for anything different in the area*
He finds nothing.
Ryker: “Give me a sign, or something!” *scans area near where the reflection where Dream appeared near Ryker was*
There’s nothing.
Ryker: *frustrated* “Pull up key Phrase “DREAM” across the multiverse please, searching for a person” *his phone appears and shows results*
There are multiple people by the name of ‘ DREAM’ but none are their Dream. Things begin flying in and out of reflections
Ryker: “Oh great. One second….” *teleports William to him*
William: “ I’m never going to get used to this. Oh hey.” 
Ryker: “Well Dreams gone. What did you do.”
William: “ what gone? Why would I do any of this? I didn’t do anything.”
Ryker: “Yeah, yeah we all know you’re not the REAL William, now spill the beans, nice try.”
William: “ look. I’ve been tortured for I don’t know how long. I am William. If you're not going to believe me, fine.”
Ryker: “Prove it.”
William: “ how?!” 
Ryker: *shrugs*
William: “ I don’t have powers. So how woul -“ * pauses.* “ What's that?” * picks up Dream’s skull mask.* 
Ryker: “How did I not see that green text? Hmmm???? Give it to me.”
That will show you not to break the rules! 
Ryker: “Let’s see here.” *snatches mask* “E Ryker?”
E Ryker: “Yes?”
Ryker: “Tracking spell.”
E Ryker: “Fine.” *puts tracking spell on it and disappears*
It doesn't have anything to track.
Ryker: *examines area around where mask was left*
Guess what? There's nothing.
Ryker: “Well what am I supposed to do?”
William: “ maybe read the writing on the inside of the mask.”
Ryker: *reads writing* “Dang…without my foresight I suck at inspecting things.”
William: “ ok?”
It says,” if you want her, come and get her!”
Ryker: “Okay. But where?”
William: “ I dunno.” 
Ryker: *pulls small trinket out of his backpack* “Okay, so this analyzes where different things come from, for example, what put this on the mask.” *scans mask with device*
It gets a ton of mixed signals.
Ryker: *presses a few buttons* “Okay. This’ll tune out Physical touch by Dream, me, and you.”
The skull is from some random deer that died.
Ryker: *checks mask for any other markings*
A strange sound happens from behind them and Radharc appears
Radharc: “What happened, time, anyways, what are you doing?”
William: * Looking for Dream.*
Radharc: “Where was she last seen?”
William: “ here.”
Radharc: “Let me try something” *Taps Cane*
When he taps it, everything glows blue then footprints appear on the ground and they move
Radharc: “The sights, how, no one else has done that but me, the footprints are where she had walked, but they are somehow, they are almost trying to hide? Do you know why?” 
William: “ no. Not really.” 
Ryker: “I’m lazy. Yes. That’s a good excuse.”
William: “ I’ve got an idea.” * shines black light on skull.* 
There is text there that says A174.
Ryker: “Here we go.” *opens portal to A174*
William: “ wait! Maybe we should think about this first.”
Ryker: *shrugs* “Fine.” *texts E Ryker “If you don’t get a text from me in 15 minutes, stop me from doing what I’m about to do.”* “That good?”
William: “ yeah let’s go.” 
Ryker: *walks through the portal*
The dimension looks destroyed, like something terrible happened here. There is a grassy hill with a big tree. Under the tree is a girl with strawberry blonde hair, she's wearing a black jacket with an odd symbol on it. She appears to be waiting for someone.
Radharc: *Goes Rigid* “This place is so broken, What happened?” *Looks around*
???: “ Oh hello Ryker. I've been waiting for you. And Radharc too. I wasn't expecting you to have company.”
Radharc: “You… I feel like I know you, who are you?”
???: * giggles* “ You don't know me. I'm a stranger. My name is Liza.”
Radharc: “What happened here?” *Is looking around but is having problems trying to Inspect the atoms.*
Liza: “ I don't know. This is just the meeting place. I've been sent here to negotiate in place of my boss.”
Radharc: “Who is your boss?”
Liza: * laughs.* “ really? You don't know?! He thought you’d know the answer to that instantly.”
Radharc: “I am sorry, I am not sure, I have been a little bit, Stuck”
Liza: “ It's ok. Now back to you.’’ * turns to look at Ryker.*
Radharc taps his cane and he is only able to change a small patch of ground
Radharc: “I do not like this place.”
Liza: “ feel free to leave.”
Radharc: “I can't, my door is not summoning. Someone is not letting me leave.”
Liza: “ allow me.” * opens a portal out of the dimension.*
Radharc: “Thank you” *Taps cane twice then walks through the portal.*
Liza: * closes portal.*
Ryker: “So. You can keep Dream. I just want to know when and where Evelin became Dream. That's it. Feel free to do whatever. I just want some time travel shenanigans.”
Liza: * laughs.* “ My boss highly douts you'll give her up so easily.”
They: “ i will destroy this doc, not on purpose but what i'm about to do will destroy the doc”
Liza: “ oh hello They. I didn't know you were there.”
They: “ bye”
THE Author: “Don’t even try it.”
They: “Be sure to prese exit” 
They: “ did it work?”
THE Author: “Don’t even try it. I will delete you from my story.”
Liza: “ I'm afraid that information is compromised.”
They: “ tell or i'll do it again.”
They: “5”
They: “4” 
They; “3”
They “2” 
They: “1” 
They: “ one last chance”
Lysa: “ I'm afraid I can't do that.”
Simon: “How come they is so destructive? I’ve literally seen him like, twice and he just is very disruptive to the lore.”
They: “ rude, fine i'll do it be sure to prese exit when the doc crashes bye now” 
The Author: “I’m sick of you. Goodbye Owen.” The Editor: “Wow……”
Simon: “ợฬєгՇץยเ๏קɭкןђﻮŦ๔รคչאςש๒ภ๓”
Liza: “ There are many things my boss can offer you but information is not one of them.”
Ryker: “Well then we have nothing to talk about.”
Liza: “ So you plan to surrender the girl?” 
Ryker: “If you give me the information I want.”
Liza: “ I'm afraid I can't do that. Information is not an option.”
Ryker: “You can get me information. Talk to your superiors.”
Liza: “ I am. They say no.”
Cancer:*appears, is in original form*”I do not think that your superiors are interested in DREAM.”
Liza: “ We plan to heal the broken parts of Dream.”
Ryker: “What's so difficult about giving me a date and location. I’ll give you literally anything for that.”
Liza: “ location is something we are not comfortable with giving.”
Cancer:”I wasn’t aware that anything was broken with dream.”
Simon: “So yeah I've got this red pig thing in my shop and he’s kind of annoying me. Does anybody want it?”
Liza: “ sir, this is a ‘no soliciting’ universe. “
Ryker: “But why not?”
Liza: “ We don't want anyone knowing our secrets.” 
Cancer:”because, we're supposed to be having negotiations with Liza and her superiors about dreams, not selling pigs.”
Simon: “His name is Elijah wood and he’s a bokoblin!”
Ryker: “I’ll find it one way or another. I’ve got the multiverse on my side.”
Liza: “ and we have protocols for that.”
Ryker: “But…do you have protocols for this!” *texts E Ryker “Summon the badgers”*
Badgers appear. The badgers go through Liza. 
Cancer:”hmm, you seem to possess at least part of Dream’s power pallet.”*floats above the badgers*
Liza:"No actually. My powers are all my own.” 
Cancer:”they are your powers, they just seem to be the same powers as Dream’s.”
Liza: “ no I have different powers,”
Nightfall
Radharc: “Tá sé in am tús a chur leis an áit seo a atógáil.” *Walks over to edge and begins to tap his cain 10 times then he pauses and does it 5 time fast*
Night fall begins to slowly rebuild itself
Radharc: “Tógfaidh sé seo roinnt ama.” *Continues* “Conas is féidir liom an leibhéal níos ísle seo a dhéanamh? Ní féidir liom é a chlúdach, tá a fhios agam conas é a dhéanamh!” *Pauses* “Jaeger, could you get me a chair, I have to keep doing this” *Still tapping the pattern*
Jaeger: “Yeah, I’m glad you are rebuilding this.” *Gets chair*
Radharc: “Thank you, This place is so complex, I am having to look at the atomic memories to remember how everything comes together. Getting down to the older area’s, that is what I have decided to call it, will be difficult, there is some kind of spell preventing me from using radharc down there.”
Jaeger: “That is concerning considering the fact that this used to be your prison.”
Radharc: “I do not think that even Neverseen knew that it was there, that part of nightfall was there before Night fell.” *Sits in chair and continues his tapping pattern* “On a more important note, That knife that I used on Scientist has been fully locked up and hidden.” *Pulls out a small monitor from his pocket and plugs it into some speakers.* “Cad atá á dhéanamh acu anois, níorbh fhéidir leo smaoineamh nach ndéanfainn iarracht féachaint cad a bhí ar siúl acu”
Jaeger: “By the way Ryker was acting… odd, he was unable to time travel and get up to his usual shenanigans, he almost seems limited.”
Dream: * appears. Her hair is a mess and she looks tired.* “ where’s… Ryker?” 
Jaeger: “Probably interrogating some poor individual.”
Ryker: “Okay buster. You’re gonna tell me the date and location.”
Liza: “ no I won’t.” 
Ryker: “Yes you will.”
Liza: * laughs.* “ You can’t make me do anything.”
Ryker: “You’ll leave eventually. And I’ll follow you.”
Liza: “ how do you know I’ll go back to my boss. I could go to Dream.”
Ryker: “Eventually you’ll go back. I’ll wait.”
Liza: * suddenly disappears.*
Ryker: *follows*
Radharc: “no” *looks closer at mirror* “What is this?” *Screams extremely loud and throws the mirror and it shatters* “NO!” *Grabs mirror and burns it then begins to smash it with his Cain* “whaattt waaassss that” *Stuttering*”ryker, i need ryker”
Ryker can’t follow her. 
Ryker: *furious, teleports to Radharc*
Radharc: “Ryker, could you look into this mirror, Something is wrong with my mirror system”
Ryker: “Mirror system?” *looks at mirror*
Radharc: “It is a system that lets me look three other mirrors within the vicinity, but look”
Ryker: “Why don’t you just use a camera. Or a phone. Or literally anything else.”
When ryker looks at the mirror at first it just shows a other room in nightfall and then the image begins to almost crack, the a strange room appears and there is a being there except his face is not visible, it is covers in scratches then Ryker begins to feel a dread and the most scared he had ever felt, then the man looks up and presses his hand to the mirror and it begins to go through  it
Radharc: *Yells, then. Shatters the mirror* “did you seeee thaaatttt”
Ryker: “Why’d you shatter the mirror? It was just a normal mirror. There was another room in nightfall. But that’s it.”
Radharc: “Did you not see the man?”
Ryker: “Man?”
Radharc: “This is not good, thank you, you can leave now”
Ryker: *begins laughing, becomes more maniacal, then, he shifts his face to disappear.*
Dream: * locks off reflections.* “ Eve? I need advice.”
Evelin: “ You know my advice. Give it to him.”
Dream: “ but I’m not sure-“
Evelin: “ look. I think that he’s trustworthy enough. And he’s worked so hard.”
Dream: * sighs and pulls out a flash drive.*
A recording plays
Ryker voice: “This triggers when my name is mentioned in Reflections when I’m not allowed in. You should let me in.”
Dream: * goes to Ryker.* “ yeah?” 
Ryker: “Dream! You’re…okay?”
Dream: “ no thanks to you. Your weird recording was playing.” 
Ryker: “You locked me out? Rude.”
Dream: “ I wanted to be alone. Also I was just KIDNAPPED. I’m locking EVERYONE out.” 
Ryker: “Fair. But what’s that in your hand?”
Dream: * opens her hand. There is nothing in it.* “ nothing.” 
Ryker: “Okay.”
Dream: “ sooooo what now?” 
Ryker: “I don’t know. You can go be alone or anything.”
Dream: “ ehh, I’m bored of that.” * looks down.* 
Ryker: “Okay. Are you remembering anything?”
Dream: “ no.” * grabs at her head.* “ Do you have my mask?” 
Ryker: *has mask in bac        kpack* “No.”
Dream: * looks him in the eyes.* “ liar.” 
Ryker: *pulls it out of backpack* “Sorry. I just wanted one. It’s pretty cool.”
Dream: “ I’ve got more. That’s just my favorite.” * takes it and puts it on.* 
Ryker: “Well. There's an evil guy in mirrors now. Anyone in Reflections?”
Dream: “ no.” * looks down at the floor and seems to remember something. Suddenly looks mad.* “ Eve! Stop it!” 
Ryker: “Eve? Are you referring to Evelin?”
Dream: * nods.* 
Ryker: “Whatcha talking about?”
Dream: * turns pale.* “ uhhh nothing. She’s just giving me a headache.” 
Ryker: “Can I talk to her?”
Dream: * hurriedly.* “ no!” 
Ryker: “Let me talk to Evelin.”
Dream: “ NO!” * shifts.* “ Ryker she’s h-“ * shifts again.* 
Ryker: “H? Are you…hiding something?”
Dream: “ no. Why would I?” * grabs head.* “ Stop it Eve!” 
Ryker: “Evelin! I’m coming to hel…” *frowns* “I…can’t.”
Dream: “ there’s no need for you to help. I’m to doing anything wrong.” 
Ryker: “Then let me talk to Evelin. If there’s nothing wrong, that shouldn’t be a problem.”
Dream: “ NO! You can’t.”
Ryker: “Why?”
Dream: “ NO! I ca- NO!”
Ryker: “Evelin. Listen to my voice. Come here. Take control.”
Dream: “ n- I can- no!” 
Ryker: “Evelin. Listen to me. You can take control. I know how hard it is. It took me 2 millennia. Just take the power.”
Dream: * disappears.* 
Ryker: *attempts to enter reflections*
He can’t. Meanwhile 
Dream: “ stop it!”
Evelin: “ what did you get the bloody thing for if you're not going to use it?!”
Dream: “ I don’t know if I can trust him.”
Evelin: “ why?!”
Dream: “ he’s not the same as…”
Evelin: “ I know. But you have to calm down.” 
Dream: “ no.”
Evelin: “ look. We’re in this together. I’ll stop, but promise me I won’t regret the decision we made.”
Dream: “ promise.”
Evelin: “ go back out.”
Dream: * turns invisible and teleports to Ryker.*
Ryker: “Why do you need a stupid contract…! Bah! I need my powers.” 
Dream: * sighs.* back to just watching. 
E Ryker: *appears* “Hey Dream, hey Ryker.”
Ryker: “Dreams not here.” 
E Ryker: “She’s right there.”
Dream: * glares at E Ryker.* you're the worst!
E Ryker: “Why aren’t you talking?”
Dream: I don’t want him to know I’m here. 
E Ryker: “It’s too late for that.”
Dream: still. 
Ryker: “Dream? Please? I’m sorry for what I said.”
Dream: “ ok.” 
Ryker: “So you’ll talk to me now?”
Dream: “ depends on what.”
Ryker: “What’s that supposed to mean?”
Dream: “ you’ll figure it out.” 
Ryker: “So can I talk to Evelin?”
Dream: “ sure.”* shifts.*
Evelin: “ Yes, Ryker?” 
Ryker: “Why was Dream not letting you talk?”
Evelin: “ she was mad at me because I was giving her a headache.”
Ryker: “Why were you giving her the headache?”
Evelin: “ I thought I would be funny.”
Ryker: “Yeah that’s not what happened. I’m not stupid.”
Evelin: “ it is what happened. You can take it or leave it but that’s what I’m going to tell you,”
Ryker: “Great.”
Evelin: “ Are we done?”
Ryker: “For now. But I’ve lost trust in you. I hope you feel guilty.”
Dream: * mutters something.*
An eerie meta green text spikes your concern
Dream: “ uhhh no it doesn't i dont feel fear or concern.” * grabs something.* “ I uhh…. Got to go.” 
Ryker: “Okay.” *teleports to Reflections, shapeshifter as a mouse*
Dream: “ you do realize that i know when everyone enters reflections right?”
Ryker: *squeaks*
Dream: * picks up Ryker mouse and puts him outside reflections.* 
Ryker: *returns to normal*
Dream: “ Me and Eve are having a PRIVATE conversation.” 
Ryker: *raises eyebrow* “Jerk move.”
Dream: “ what do you mean by that?”
Ryker: “You lie to me, don’t apologize, and then now you’re trying to hide something from me. I don’t find you a good person.”
Dream: “ yeah and YOU lied to me and didn’t apologize about it. You imprisoned 5 girls and tortured them and kidnapped a baby and hid it in a closet. Plus you went to court. You're not much better.” 
Ryker: “I never said I was, but I’m trying to get better.” *frowns* “The court case helped. It stopped all going to my head.”
Dream: “ Still I’m trying to be better too.”
Ryker: *raises eyebrow* “Sure.”
Dream: “ Also I’m not hiding anything.” 
Ryker: “Of course not.”
Dream: “ see you agree with me. Now I have something important to do.” 
Ryker: “Of course!”
Dream: “ unless you have something important to talk about I’m going to go.” 
Ryker: “Great. Goodbye.”
Dream: * goes back to reflections.* 
Ryker: *waits*
Meanwhile 
Evelin: “ yes?”
Dream: “ I think maybe we should use the information.”
Evelin: “ to do what?”
Dream: “ I don’t know. We could find out pretty much anything.”
Evelin: “ look you do realize he was just trying to get in your head right?”
Dream: “ how do I know that?”
Evelin: “ what? You trust him over Ryker?” 
Dream: “ no I just- I don’t know what to think.” * begins looking at other characters through reflections.* 
Ryker: *fiddling his thumbs, then transforms hand into hat*
Dream: “ well that happened.” 
Ryker: *looks around* “Dream?” *changes hat back to hand*
Dream: * doesn’t say anything.* 
Ryker: *shrugs* “Okay.” *he shapeshifts into Dream* “I’m hiding something and I won’t tell you.” *shapeshifts into Wiziker* “The Council will decide your fate.” *shapeshifts to E Ryker* “This is all my fault!” *shapeshifts back to himself and frowns*
Dream: * giggles.* 
Ryker: *looks around again* “Dream?” *waits for a response* “Oh well.” *frowns*
Dream: * pulls a rug out from under him.* 
Ryker: *looks straight at her* “All right. I know you’re there. Go do what you need to or whatever.”
Dream: “ I’m done.” 
Ryker: “Great. Are you ready to tell me something now?”
Dream: “ I could tell you hundreds of things.” 
Ryker: “You know what I mean.”
Dream: “ Well I’m still debating whether I trust you or not sooo…” 
Ryker: “Trust me! I’m literally just trying to do something good with my life for once.”
Dream: “ you call time shenanigans something good?” 
Ryker: “At least I have goals.”
Dream: “ goals are for those who plan to do something with their future.”
Ryker: “Exactly.”
Dream: “ Bold of you to assume I have plans for my future.” 
Ryker: “I never said you do, in fact I assumed the opposite.”
Dream: “ ok. I still don’t see your point.” 
Ryker: “I mean, I’m learning, trying to grow as a person, such as not betraying people's trust.”
Dream: “ your- never mind.” 
Ryker: “What were you going to say?”
Dream: “ That's not something I want to talk about.”
Ryker: “Oh wow. Reaaal Trustworthy.”
Dream: “ I never said I was trustworthy. Just that I don’t really trust you.”
Ryker: “What do you expect? I can’t gain your trust. You’ll always doubt me because of a past I’m not responsible for.”
Dream: “ no. I did trust you.”
Ryker:  “And you don’t anymore?”
Dream: “ I don’t know.” 
Ryker: “What changed your perspective?”
Dream: “ tell me something. Before I came back, were you negotiating with an agent from the shady organization?” 
Ryker: “Shady Organization?”
Dream: “ the one that created me.” 
Ryker: “If I was negotiating with them, then why would I not know where and when you’re from.”
Dream: * looks upset.* “ and that’s why I don’t trust you.”
Ryker: “I mean when I thought you were kidnapped a while ago I talked to someone, but I didn’t negotiate, cause they wouldn’t give me what I wanted.”
Dream: * looks down.* “ oh. Ok.”
Ryker: “Does that make me more or less trustworthy?”
Dream: “ it confirms that I can’t-“ * disappears.* 
Ryker: “Dream?” *teleports into reflections*
Dream: * is kneeling in front of a mirror.* “ yeah?” 
Ryker: “You just disappeared on me.”
Dream: * seems distracted.* “ Oh sorry.” 
Ryker: “You seem distracted.”
Dream: * looks at him.* “ You have my full attention.”  
Ryker: “Don’t do that to me! I was worried! The last time you did that…”
Dream: “ sorry. I didn’t think you would care”
Ryker: “Why wouldn’t I?”
Dream: * mumbles.* “ I don’t know.” 
Ryker: “I’m sorry you feel that way.”
Dream: “ It's fine.” 
Ryker: *glares* “No! I’m sick of you! Leave!”
Dream: “ who?” 
Ryker: *looks at Dream* “Oh…um” *face looks determined* “Ya know what. No. I’ll keep my secret until you tell yours.”
Dream: “ you tell me first.” 
Ryker: “I'm talking to Rusulka. My alter-base ego.”
Dream: “ I have the information you want.” 
Ryker: “But you won’t tell me, will you.”
Dream: “ it’s on a flash drive.” 
Ryker: “Right. Can I please have it?”
Dream: * mumbles.* “ I don’t know.” 
Ryker: “Right. I’ll give you a date and location if you give me yours.”
Dream: “ what date and location?” 
Ryker: “I like to call it my release. You know how I was combined with Smile and Mimick? I’ll give you the exact point in time where that occurred.”
Dream: “ why would I want that?” 
Ryker: *shrugs* “An origin for an origin, that’s what I say.”
Dream: “ I’m not interested in that. I’ll just get combined with Mimick and smile. One other personality is enough.” 
Ryker: “What about the opposite, where I was split. That affects a BUNCH of stuff.”
Dream” I don’t really want that either. I already watched it happen.” * shifts.* “ She's not going to give you it.”  
Ryker: “I don’t get it. Why is she afraid?”
Evelin: “ it’s easier if I show you.” 
Ryker: “Go ahead.”
Evelin: “ Can you still read minds?” 
Ryker: *pauses* “No.”
Evelin: “ ok.” * projects on a mirror.”
It appears to be in Dreams perspective. It’s all dark so she can't see. She is ramming into an invisible barrier. 
???:  * is a familiar man’s voice coming from everywhere.* “ You shouldn’t put so much trust into him.”
Dream: “ I don’t trust you.”
???: * laughs.* “ I’m not talking about me.”
Dream: “ who then.”
???:” I think you know who I mean.”
Dream: “ I trust him more than you!”
???: “ oh? Then where is your friend?”
Dream: “ he’ll come.”
???: “ he doesn't care. You want to know where he is. He is negotiating with one of my agents. He says he’d give you up for the information.”
Dream: “ You're lying!”
???: “am I?”
Dream: “ stop!”
???: I know what you're doing. But unfortunately he’s gone. You can’t replace him.”
Dream: “ STOP!”
???: “ you shouldn’t be so willing to trust someone who would sell you for information.”
Dream: “ STOP!!!”
It ends. 
Ryker: “Well that’s just great. I feel stupid now. I was trying to get her back for free. And it worked.”
Evelin: “ fair. And I don’t blame you. I’ve worked with these people and one thing that they use the most is manipulation. I know you're not stupid enough to sell us for information.”  
Ryker: “Is Dream hearing this?”
Evelin: * nods.* 
Cancer:*manipulates mirror in reflections to watch*”That’s good, she needs to hear this.”
Ryker: “Look I’m sorry. I’m willing to offer pretty much anything for that drive.”
Dream: “ I guess. Just promise me I won’t regret this.”
Ryker: “You won’t. I’m not going to be stupid.” 
Dream: “ ok.” * gives him flash drive.* 
Cancer:”Do you need a computer for that?”
Ryker: “I’ve got a laptop in my backpack.” *pulls it out and plugs in flash drive*
Cancer:”ok”
The date is 2 years and 5 months ago and the location is a dimension known as 38b3.
Ryker: “I see.” *he suddenly vanishes, and goes directly back in time and spot to the exact location of the lab, leaving a note that says…”I’m sorry. This is probably a bad idea.”*
Cancer:”well I guess i'm here with you until he gets back.”
Dream: “ Well this is why when I find something I don’t give it to him.” 
Cancer:”yeah, that makes sense, whenever he gets something he tends to like to go back in time and screw with something.”
Back in Time
Ryker: *appears in [insert location here]*
Woman: “ we’re ready in 3..2..1..”
Ryker: *suddenly in about the course of three seconds, Ryker shapeshifts into Evelin, teleports her to a random undisclosed location, and replaces her, so smoothly that no one could tell*
He feels a huge pain in his chest like it’s being split open. There’s so much noise in his head that he can’t think. 
Ryker: *flinches*
He feels something hit into his back and then his memories go fuzzy. The noise stops but he still feels the pain in his chest. He feels angry, scared, and confused at the same time. 
Ryker: *used to feeling numerous emotions and things in his head at the same time, in Evelin’s voice* “Did…it work?”
There is a beeping noise.
???: “ Evelin? How do you feel?” 
Ryker: *still in voice* “Hungry.”
Woman: “ odd. That wasn’t to be expected.”
???: “ Evelin? Are you being honest?” 
Ryker: *voice* “Somewhat. I also have a Small headache. My mouth tastes a bit funny too.”
???: * pauses.* “ You're not Evelin. Who are you?” 
Ryker: *returns to normal form* “I call myself Ryker. It’s a pleasure to meet you.”
???: “ Well Ryker, I think you’ll make a fantastic addition to our research.”
Ryker starts to feel a little dizzy. 
Ryker: *teleports Evelin into the room* “Y'all say hi to Dream from me. And if you're curious, find SOUR.” *faints*
Dream: * grabs Ryker and takes him back to reflections.* 
Ryker: *wakes up*
Dream: * slaps him.* “ That was a stupid thing to do. I warned you not to do anything stupid.” 
Ryker: “I’m fine.”
Dream: “ still.” * slaps him again.* 
Ryker:”So now what?” *faints again*
Dream: “ we find William.” 
Ryker: *begins to mutter in his sleep* “No! Chris…My tongue! Howdy there! I’ve existed! It’s good to be back…”
Dream: “ That's normal.”
Ryker: *jolts awake* “Who? What? Dream?”
Dream: “ yeah?” 
Ryker: “Get William quickly! Or I’m gonna fall unconscious again…”
Dream: “ well I don't think he got any control. I’m reading your mind right now and I can’t Sense it.”
Ryker: “So why’d you save me?”
Dream: “ I saved you BEFORE it could happen.” 
Ryker: “What could happen?”
Dream: “ he could take control.”
Ryker: “Who?” *pauses* “You’ll never be specific enough for me. I need to understand you.” *texts E Ryker: “Plan Alpha54. Now.”* 
E Ryker: *suddenly appears and immediately pauses time, knocks Dream out teleports her into an anti-power zone, and guards her* “Sorry Dream, Ryker has all sorts of plans for when you go evil, ever since the last time you tried…”
Meanwhile…
Ryker: *returns to the exact place and time where he was saved from by Dream, and takes his place there again*
The same thing happens.
Ryker: *faints after feeling dizzy*
Woman: “ Are you in?”
???: “ It's much harder but yes.” 
Meanwhile 
Dream: * wakes up.* “ Dang it. Uhhh can I leave now.” 
E Ryker: “I’m sorry, but Ryker tells me no. To wait till he gets back.” 
Dream: “ you do realize he isn’t coming back right? I was the only thing making it so he could come back.” 
E Ryker: “How’s about this. We wait an hour or so, see if he comes back, and if he doesn’t, I’ll let you go.”
Dream: “ fine. But I hate being contained.” 
E Ryker: “I get it. Here’s a deck of cards.” *summons one for her* “and if you want to play chess, just ask.”
Dream: * begins playing solitaire. Five minutes later.* “ Has it been an hour yet????”
E Ryker: “5 minutes.”
Dream: “ how about now?”
E Ryker: *gives her a clock to show the passage of time*
Dream: * sets it aside.* “ How about now?” 
E Ryker: “I was trying to be nice. But now you get to deal with Hyper.”
Dream: “ yay. I like Hyper.” 
E Ryker: “Wellthankyouthastsquiteniceforyoutoaay!”
Dream: “ thanks.finalysomethingtodo!” 
Meanwhile
Ryker: *jerks awake*
He is in a chamber. 
Ryker: “Hello? William? Dream?” *looks for an exit* 
There is none.
Ryker: “Anyone?” *looks around for a speaker or viewing room of some sort, along with any other objects in the room*
There is nothing.
Ryker: *shapeshifts into a chair*
He can’t there’s something keeping him from changing.
???: * a voice in Rykers head that sounds like his own voice.* “ don’t do that! It’s boring. You should set something on fire instead.” 
Ryker: “I mean I agree with you but you’re new, what’s your name? Should I call you Arson?” *lights floor on fire*
???: “ I’m uhh… Arson yeah Arson.”
Ryker: “Well welcome to the voices in my head gang. It used to be a lot worse, but now it’s better. Only one other person.” 
Arson: “we should get out of here. I can't stand being cooped up.”
Ryker: “Fair enough. But how.”
Arson: “ leave that to me.”
Ryker is sent to the mind scape where he has no control over his body.
Arson: * in Rykers body. runs around lighting stuff on fire.* “ wooohooo.”
Ryker: “Hey buddy, this isn’t really helping either of us.”
Arson: “ Sure it is.” 
Ryker: “Explain.”
Arson: “ The fire will destroy the room.”
Ryker: “It doesn’t seem to be working.”
Arson: “ That means we need MORE FIRE!!!!!”
Ryker: “Or that means that fire isn’t working.”
Arson: “ No, it means we need more fire.” 
Ryker: “I can see this’ll get annoying.”
Arson: “ well too bad. We're stuck together whether you like it or not.”
Ryker: “Well technically…No.”
Arson: “ Yes we are. So now MORE FIRE.” * adds more fire.*
Ryker: “If you give me control I can totally split us.”
Arson: “ no. I like this body and I think I'll keep it.”
Ryker: “It used to be much more powerful y’know. Since technically you aren’t Ryker, I guess that means you gain access to all of them.”
Arson: “ I don't care about other powers. I'm happy to just light stuff on fire.”
Ryker: “But why? I mean I get that fire is fun, but still.”
Arson: “ because destruction.”
Ryker: “There is a LOT more destruction we could be doing.”
Arson: “ That's why we need to get out.”
Ryker: “Well just teleport out then. I don’t have any control.”
Arson: “ we can do that?!” 
Ryker: “We can do pretty much anything we put our mind to. I told you we were powerful.”
Arson: * tries to teleport out but there is pain that resonates through his whole body.* “ OWWWW! I thought you said we could teleport!” 
Ryker: “We usually can. I’m betting they’re somehow blocking our powers right now.”
Arson: “ That's no fun. We need to unblock our powers!” 
Ryker: “Yeah we do. But how? It's not like we can get out of this room.”
Arson: “ oh i know. MORE FIRE!!!!” 
Ryker: “Here’s an idea. EXPLOSION!”
Arson: “ YESSS!!!” * He tries but a shock goes through the body.* “ OWWWW!!!!” 
Ryker: “Okay this is stupid. What do they want from us?”
Arson: “ I don't know.” 
Ryker: “Do we just wait?”
Arson: “ NEVER!!!!” 
Ryker: “We should probably ask Rusulka.”
Arson: “ Who?!” 
Ryker: “The third personality.”
Rusulka: “Me.”
Arson: “ Who are you?” 
Rusulka: “Rusulka.”
Arson: “ weird.” 
Ryker: “Yeah. Anyways….Fire?”
Arson: “ YESSS!”
Ryker: “Or…ACID!”
Arson: “ EVEN BETTER!” 
Ryker: “Well go ahead!”
Arson: * tries only to get another shock.* “ OWWWW!!” 
Ryker: “Give me control for a sec. I’ve got an idea.”
Arson: “ NOOOOO!!!!!” 
Ryker: “Well in this body we all have equal say in things. So Rusulka? Should I take control?”
Rusulka: *sighs* “I don’t care.”
Arson: “ NOOOOO!!! MY TURN!!!” 
Ryker: “Fine, but we get equal turns.”
Arson: “ … maybe.” 
Ryker: “Okay…So what's your bright idea?”
Arson: “ MORE FIRE!!!!” 
Ryker: “Go ahead. But it won’t work. You’ll see.”
Arson: “ it will.” 
There is a loud beeping sound 
???: “ Well boys I think I've seen quite enough. thank you.” 
Arson: * glares.* “ YOU LET US GO RIGHT NOW!!!”
???: * laughs.* “ I'm afraid you all will have to stay for quite awhile.”
Ryker: “Tell him that I’ll reward him if he sets us free.”
Arson: “ no! He doesn't deserve a reward!” 
Ryker: “I get that, but if we can get out by giving him one, then that benefits us too.”
Arson: “ no.”
???: * laughs.* “ You two can't get along, can you?” 
Ryker: “We can get along just fine enough to beat you up! Yeah..say that! Or…we need to find William.”
Arson: “ who?” 
Ryker: “It’s this guy that’ll help us escape.”
Arson: “ we don't need-”
They suddenly pass out. Meanwhile 
Dream: “ hasssitbeeenannnhouuuryeeeeet??????”
E Ryker: *checks watch* “Yes.” *lets her go*
Dream: “ FINALLY!!!!!!” 
E Ryker: “So are you going to save Ryker now? Or should I? Or?”
Jaeger: “What did Ryker do this time?”
E Ryker: “Time Travel.”
Jaeger: “I thought he was not capable of it due to his…. current state.”
E Ryker: “That was one of the four he chose to keep.”
Jaeger: “I see, so he did something that probably got him in trouble/something wrong again?”
E Ryker: “It's more my fault but yes.”
Jaeger: “Should we go help him?”
E Ryker: *winces* “I don’t think so..I can’t get a good neural connection right now…so he’s probably trying to hide something from me.”
Jaeger: “Crap, guess we’ll just have to try another way to find him, on a related note, Dream, do you know where he is?”
Dream: “ I'll retrieve him.” * goes to reflections to look for him.*
Meanwhile
Arson: “ owww.” 
Ryker: “What? Where are we?”
Arson: “ same place. Except they put the fire out.”
Ryker: “And let me guess. The fire doesn’t work anymore.”
Arson: * shrugs. He suddenly feels like someone just slapped him in the face.* “ Oww.”
Dream: “ that's for cooping me up!”
Arson: “ what are you talking about? I don't even know you!”
Ryker: “That’s Dream.”
Arson: “ oh, hi Dream.”
Dream: “ Ryker, who are you talking to?”
Arson: “ I'm not Ryker. I'm Arson.”
Ryker: “Don’t say that! Quick! Act like you were joking…we can use this…TO LIGHT MORE FIRES!”
Arson: “ uhh i was … joking?”
Dream: “ Ryker, I can read his mind.”
Ryker: “Wait…so you can hear me?”
Dream: “ yup.”
Arson: “ aww so we can’t light stuff on fire?”
Dream: “ oh now i see why you named him Arson.” 
Ryker: “Arson, Dream is you from a different timeline.”
Arson: “ really?”
Dream: “ yeah.”
Arson: “ Do you like lighting stuff on fire too?” 
Dream: “ yes but Evelin wont let me.”
Ryker: “Evelin is the person Dream has with her, like me with you. Evelin is weak though. We’re MUCH stronger than them.”
Arson: “ Well that explains why you're so boring.”
Ryker: “I know right?”
Arson: “ No, I meant you.”
Ryker: “What! Boring?!”
Arson: “ yeah you won't let me do anything fun.”
Ryker: “I’m letting you do anything you want. I’m giving you full control. It’s not my fault we’re stuck here.”
Arson: “ It's not?!”
Ryker: “No!”
Arson: “ still.”
Ryker: “Why’d you blame me? I’m trying to get us out of here?”
Meanwhile
E Ryker: “So? Milk?”
Jaeger: “Yeah sure, want cookies with that?”
E Ryker: “Yeah. What about carrots?”
Jaeger: “Yeah, and cereal?”
E Ryker: “Oooh! Strawberry!”
Jaeger: “Choco”
E Ryker: “Oh don’t forget little kids fingers!”
Jaeger: “Okay… never tried that I wish Dream had told us where they went.”
E Ryker: “Yeah….”
Meanwhile
Arson: “ soooo are we just going to sit here all day orr…”
Ryker: “I don’t know.”
Dream: “ oh right i'm here to break you out.” * opens a portal to reflections and shoves Arson through.* 
Ryker: “Great.”
Dream: “ Now revenge.” * traps Arson in a circle of salt.* 
Ryker: “Arson didn’t do anything!”
Dream: “ sorry Arson. It's nothing personal. I'm trying to get back at Ryker.” 
Arson: “ your turn.” * gives Ryker back the body.*
Ryker: “Arson. We can totally get out of here and light things on fire. One of my powers is to ignore weaknesses.“ *pauses* “Oh great, right when I needed you to do something.” *pulls out tongue (hoodie string) and sends it to lick the salt.*
It is also trapped.
Ryker: “Haha, very funny.” *attempts to walk out*
He runs into an invisible barrier. 
Ryker: *teleports to 3 feet to the left, outside of the salt*
It doesn't work.
Ryker: “Your turn Arson, do what I said, and we can light stuff on fire.” *gives up control*
Arson: * tries lighting stuff on fire.* 
The fire can't go outside the barrier. 
Ryker: “Subdued by Salt! We’re not a snail! Counterspell go!”
Arson: “ yeah but we're a demon. there is no counter spell.”
Ryker: “Well….I mean….I have an idea…blow on the salt.”
Arson: * tries blowing on salt. It doesn't work.*
Dream: “ this is so amusing.” 
Ryker: *calls E Ryker* “Yeah, Check Reflections.”
E Ryker: *attempt to teleport to Reflections, telling Jaeger* “Oh, she blocked us.”
E Ryker has been blocked from reflections. 
Dream: * laughs.* 
Jaeger: *Tries to go to reflections*
He is blocked too.
Ryker: “So why?”
Dream: “ this is for all the times you did this to me.” 
Ryker: “I’ve done this once. And for a good reason.”
Dream: “ twice. Also you had E Ryker contain me. You will live to regret that.” 
Arson: “ RYKER! Why?!” 
Ryker: “Um. For a variety of reasons.”
Arson: “ what have you done?! Now we’re stuck here!” 
Ryker: “Yeah. From one prison to another.”
Dream: “ I’m going to let you out. Just wait…. An hour.”
Arson: “ NOOOO!!!!” 
Ryker: “Okay. Wanna play Go Fish Arson?”
Arson: “ No, I want to be FREE!” 
Ryker: “Well now what.”
Dream: “ you sit there for an hour.” 
One hour later
Ryker: “How about now?”
Dream: “ you still have 15 minutes.”
Arson: “ WHAT!” 
Cancer:*manipulates mirror*”HAHAHAHAHA?” 
Dream: “ ok you're done.” * breaks the circle of salt.*
Arson: “ YES!! FREEDOM!!!!” * begins running around.* 
Cancer:”you are cooped up”
Arson: “ an hour! An hour! I can’t stand being in one place for THAT long!” 
Cancer:”as compared to a couple millennia in an ocean-y abyss?”
Ryker: “I agree.”
Arson: “ Now to not share the body.” 
Cancer:”with who? I need to learn how to read minds, I really do. Its very useful to know what's going on in the person’s mind who is next to you.”
Arson: “ So I totally know this person because I’m … Ryker.” 
Cancer:”ya know, you're kinda lying. That much i can tell”
Arson: “ I’m Arson.” 
Cancer:”okay. So you’ve taken over Ryker’s body?”
Arson: “ I’m a part of Ryker. Well kinda. I’m his second personality.”
Cancer:”all of his other personalities are in E-ryker. Where did you come from?”
Arson: “ I don’t really know.” 
Cancer:”Well that’s not helpful, although I really shouldn’t expect anyone to be helpful at this point.”
Arson: “ Well now to set stuff on fire.” 
Cancer:”That's why you're called arson. Wonderful. Now there will be many eternal fires going all over the multiverse.”
Arson: “ YES!!!” 
Ryker: “So… now what?”
Dream: “ I don’t know. What happened in the facility?”
Ryker: “Not a lot. I mean, Arson woke up, and we were limited in our power, but it wasn’t too bad. It’s kinda hard to refer to myself normally anymore.”
Dream: “ huh, weird.” 
Ryker: “Yeah, it hadn’t really happened before, I mean other than Rimisile.”
Arson: “ oh right I forgot about him.” 
Ryker: “You…know about Rimisile?”
Arson: “ the other guy in our head?” 
Ryker: “No, that's Rusulka. Rimisile is something entirely different.”
Arson: “ oh.”
Ryker: “Yeah. You want a brief overview of my history?” *loosens up hold on most of his memories and provides them to Arson*
Arson: “ … ohhhh. I like the part where you set that pit on everlasting fire.”
Ryker: “Yeah, do ya kinda get me slightly better now?” *pauses* “Y’know what, since there’s the two of us, I think we need a redesign. Thoughts? What do we want the body to look like?”
Arson: * shrugs.* 
Ryker: “Hmmm. So we like fire. We could do something with a Phoenix. We do some fire wings, black and red garb, like my hoodie. We change eye color to red, some black jeans, obviously soft, and I don’t know, red hair and some horns. Any input?”
Arson: “ I like how this body looks. Well, maybe red eyes.” 
Ryker: “All right. Go ahead.”
Arson: * gives himself red eyes.* “ like fire.”
Ryker: “Yeah, cool. Or hot I guess.” *pauses* “So now what?”
Dream: * shrugs.* 
Ryker: “I mean. This has been my goal since I met you. But now that I’m done…I don’t know what to do.”
Dream: “ how am I supposed to know.”
Arson: “ LIGHT FIRES!!!!” 
Ryker: “I have an idea for a goal. But first….Arson, could I have control?”
Arson: “ …… no.”
Ryker: “Please?”
Arson: “ noooooo.” 
Ryker: “I have other ways to make you give up control. Release. Now.”
Arson: “ nooooo.” 
Dream: * laughs.* “ It seems you're having trouble controlling your split personality.”
Ryker: “I’ve got this. Rusulka.” *Suddenly Arson is thrown out of controls and locked from the main room.* “Feel free to talk, but I’m in control. I have experience dealing with annoyances like you. Lazy taught me.”
It doesn't work
Evelin: “ welcome to the magical world of having a machine made split personality. In order for you to take control he has to surrender his.” 
Ryker: “Well this is much more annoying than a Ryker based personality. I mean Mimick and Smile were rough enough. Arson. Can we come to some sort of deal? You controlling the body for the whole time is unfair.”
Arson: “ fiiiiiinnnne.” 
Ryker: “Thanks.” *takes control, grabs a hard drive from a place in SOUR, and uploads it to his brain.* “Our goal is a backstory conglomerate. Also, say hi to Rain everyone. Rain, you are allowed one customization to our appearance.”
Rain: “ umm I don’t know.”
Arson: “ awww. rain kills fire.” 
Ryker: “We could…change hair color, outfit, age… anything.”
Rain: * stressed.* “ I don’t know.” 
Ryker: “When you decide just let me know. For now, this feels like enough people.” *gives up control*
Arson: “ mine!” * takes control.* “ Ok, so one question. Why is she here?”
Dream: “ Ryker 101. He likes to do random stuff for no reason.”
Ryker: “I’m gathering peoples backstories. I’m thinking Radharc next. Possibly Jaeger.”
Dream: “ Rain doesn’t know anything about her backstory. Ask Rae.”
Rain: * somehow takes control.* “ This feels weird.”
Arson: “ WHA-! How’d you do that?!”
Rain: “ I dunno.” 
Ryker: “Rain is Rae’s backstory, kinda like how Arson is yours. That’s all I’m doing.”
Dream: “ so you're filling your mindscape of consciousness connected to people’s backstories. Why?” 
Ryker: “Why not?”
Rain: “ I don’t like it here. Can I leave?” 
Ryker: “Nope. Too late now! You’re stuck in here. But, you can change things about our appearance.”
Rain: “ NO! I want out!” * somehow separates herself from Ryker.* 
Arson: “ why is this person so good at breaking rules?” 
Ryker: “If you want to leave, feel free. You can keep a copy of my body.”
Rain: “ no.” * disappears.* 
Ryker: “I was talking to Arson. So, what do you say?”
Arson: “ I like it here. I’m just confused why she gets more power.”
Dream: “ because Ryker just shoved her in. You guys have something keeping you together. And you have a lot less freedom because of it. Also different people or consciousness have different powers and effects on the body and mind.” 
Ryker: “I mean, I deal with people in my head all the time. What’s my power?”
Dream: “ experience.” 
Ryker: “Well how do you spread equal time between you and Evelin? It’s not ever one sided.”
Evelin: “ We don't share equally. I just prefer not to be in control.” 
Ryker: “Not it control? Then what do you do in your free time?”
Evelin: “ make sure Dream doesn't burn Reflections down.”
Ryker: “Well that’s somewhat annoying. We need to make some form of deal, Arson. How about we trade off every hour?”
Arson: “ no.”
Ryker: “Any help Evelin?”
Evelin: “ look after two years being stuck with Dream i learned a few things. Like how to make your other person miserable and how to take control.”
Ryker: “Any way we can talk privately so Arson doesn’t hear? I need to know how to take control.”
Evelin: “ no he can almost always hear you.”
Ryker: “Well that’s annoying. Just tell me anyway. Arson has a short attention span.”
Arson: “ no I-” * immediately gets distracted.*
Evelin: * explains how to take control.* “ Also with enough concentration you can make them do small things. Why do you think Dream always acts suspicious when she's hiding something.”
Dream: “ yeah it's REALLY annoying.”
Ryker: “Arson? Can you stop setting Wiziker on fire remotely? It's a bit annoying.”
Arson: * is using reflections to set Wiziker on fire.* “ awwww. But that was fun.”
Ryker: “Wait. Do we get our own Reflections?”
Dream: “ no. You would have had to have William bust you out for that to happen. Also there's only one Reflections.”
Ryker: “Dang it! I wanted another free universe.”
Arson: “ why? I'd just set it on fire anyway.” 
Ryker: “But then we get a cool fiery mirror realm. Wouldn’t that be cool?”
Arson: “ no cause then it wouldn’t burn.”
Ryker: “So wouldn’t it be hot?”
Arson: “ NO!”
Ryker: “Well now I’m confused.”
Arson: “ good.”
Ryker: “Hmm. What should we call ourselves…Arykeson?”
Arson: “ NO! Just Ryker and Arson!”
Cancer:”yeah, that would be confusing and a mouthful.”
Ryker: “Fair.”
Arson: * goes back to lighting Wiziker on fire.* 
Ryker: “Why!”
Arson: “ because! You know what?! I'm done with you telling me what to do!” * makes it so no one can hear anything Ryker says.*
Cancer:”Well, you're not in control and I would like to talk to ryker, not the fire making nuttso who is in control.”
Arson: “ NO! Ryker is on time out!”
Cancer:”somehow i doubt that. You're probably just taking over for forever.”
Dream: “ no. I can't hear Ryker anymore. Also how'd you do that?’’
Cancer:”yeah… dream should be able to hear ryker. You’re taking over Arson”
E Ryker: “That’s rough buddy.”
Cancer:”yeah, you should be able to take over from Arson. That’s real rough.”
Arson: “ I just don't like him telling me what to do.”
Cancer: “well I don’t think that he likes you controlling the body.”
Arson: “ Fiiiiiine.” * surrenders control.*
Dream: “ thank you Arson.”
Arson: * mumbles something.*
Dream: * giggles.* “ hmmm i wonder….”  
Cancer:”wonder what…?”
Dream: “ No, it's a terrible idea.”
Arson: “ YES we should do that!”
Cancer:”what are you guys talking about?”
Dream: “ I shouldn't tell.”
Cancer:*glares*”really. I think that you should”
Dream: “ Nope!”
Arson: “ pleeaassseeee.” 
Cancer:”Does it involve me.?”
Dream: “ maybe.” 
Cancer:”that makes it a yes. I don’t know what you are planning to do, but I really would like it if you wouldn’t do it.”
Dream: “ we shouldn’t.”
Arson: “ Come on, please.”
Cancer:”I think that we shouldn’t.”
Dream: “ you don't even know what ‘it’ is.”
Cancer:”Well Arson wants to do it so that probably means that we don’t want to do it.”
Arson: “ why?! I have very good ideas.” * pauses.* “ Oh wait. You can't hear me. This sucks.”
Dream: “ Welcome to my world. I had an evil A.I. in my conscience that forced me to sit down and be quiet.”
Arson: “ rough.”
Dream; “ for a Year!” 
Cancer:”Should I go learn how to read minds so that Arson can talk to me?”
Dream: * giggles.* “ No you shouldn’t.”
Arson: “ you suck!” 
Dream: * laughs.* 
Cancer:”think I will just know what arson just said. Goodbye, I will be back in a couple of minutes.”*vanishes*
Arson: “ uhhhh this SUCKS.” 
Dream: “ yeah i know.” 
Cancer:*returns*”kay, Arson, is there anything that you want to say, because it just took me a month to learn how to read minds so it better be worth it.”
Arson:“wellllllllll.imkindaboardanddontlikeitherebecauseImstuckinoneplaceandcan’taccuallyTALKtoanyone.soyeahimstuckinoneplaceandinscilencesoooooyeah.”
Cancer:”that was a very long spiel and I am very sorry for your cooped up ness.”
Arson: “ silence is the WORST!” 
Cancer:”I had to endure it for several millennia, I didn't know what sound was for several millennia, actually.”
Arson: “ rough.”
Cancer:”It wasn’t until I learned what it was. Then it was.”
Ryker: “Sound? Sound is a recent development in the multiverse.”
Arson: “ hu. Also Dream pleeeeeaaaasssseeee.”
Dream: “ I don’t think that’s up to me.” 
Ryker: “Oh. All you want is something interesting to do in the mindscape while you’re waiting? I can do that! Lazy built an amusement park in our head once. So what do you want?”
Arson: “ I don’t know.” 
Cancer:”you don’t want the amusement park? There aren’t any lines to wait in I would think.”
Arson: “ What's an amusement park?” 
Ryker: “It's…oh here you go.” *Gives information about amusement parks*
Arson: “ no.” 
Ryker: “What do you want then? A flaming forest?”
Arson: “ tempting but fires no fun unless you set it.”
Ryker: “Then how about a flammable area you can set on fire.”
Arson: “ it won’t burn.”
Ryker: “It comes equipped with a flamethrower, and powers can be used in the mindscape.”
Arson: “ I know. But it’s just not as good as being In real life.” 
Ryker: “But it’s better than just sitting there.”
Arson: * mutters something.* 
Ryker: “What was That?”
Arson: * mutters something else.* 
Ryker: “Speak up.”
Arson: * glares at Ryker.* 
Ryker: “What!”
Arson: * mutters something.* 
Ryker: “Oh for Pete’s sake.”
Arson: * laughs.* 
Ryker: “What!”
Arson: * laughs again.* 
Ryker: “WHAT DO YOU WANT!?!?”
Arson: “ something to do.”
Ryker: “But what were you muttering about?”
Arson: * mutters something.* 
Ryker: “LIKE THAT!”
Arson: * laughs.*
Ryker: “WHY?!?”
Arson: “ because it's funny.”
Ryker: *mutters something*
Arson: * laughs.*
Ryker: “It’s not funny!”
Arson: “ You're right. It's VERY funny.”
Ryker: “Bah!!”
Arson: * mutters something.*
Cancer:”it's not very fun listening to you just mutter things. Speak up. I didn’t start hearing to not hear you talking.”
Arson: “ You can't make me speak up.” * mutters some more.* 
Cancer:”well you just did.”*grins*
Arson: * mutters something else.* 
Cancer:*summons speaker and makes it so that whatever arson says is blasted on the speaker*”now you can’t mutter”
Ryker: “But…”
Cancer:”but what?”
Doesn’t work because Arson isn’t saying anything
Arson: * laughs.* 
Cancer:*makes it so that his mind speak is played on the speaker*
That doesn’t work either. 
Arson: * mutters something.* 
Cancer:*mutters back and grins*
Arson: * laughs.* “ You have no idea what I said, do you?” 
Cancer:”no. I don't, I'll just make it so that you want to know what I'm saying.”
Arson: “ I don't really care.” 
Cancer:”okay.”
Arson: “ ok. Im booooaaaaaarrrrrrrddddd.” 
Cancer:”Well, then why don’t you tell me what you were saying, that would be fun and not boring, right?!”
Arson: “ but that would ruin the fun of torturing you.” 
Cancer:”Well then don’t complain about being bored.”
Arson: “ Well I can't technically complain.” 
Cancer:”then don’t”
Arson: “ I'm not. But i'm still bored.” 
Cancer:”Well then you're complaining because you're saying that you're bored.”
Arson: “ false. At the moment I can't technically talk so that means that I can't complain.” 
Cancer:”your mind talking, which is still talking. And you can still complain without talking.”
Arson: “ nope. My mind isn’t talking. I'm just thinking.”
Cancer:”thinking whatever, it’s still complaining.”
Arson: “ no. you have to be able to talk to complain.”
Cancer:”that’s not how that works.”
Arson: “ sure it is. So you can’t blame me for complaining because I'm not.”
Cancer: “who said that I was blaming you for complaining, i was just saying that you were.”
Arson: “ Well that statement is false.” 
Cancer:”how is it false? I’m stating the facts.”
Arson: “ no. I can't talk so therefore I can't complain. I am simply being upset about being stuck here.” 
Cancer:”I don't get where you're getting the ‘ I have to be able to talk in order to complain’ you can still complain without talking.”
Arson: “ nope. Complaining is when you tell someone about how you are upset about something but I CAN'T talk to you about anything.” 
Cancer: “ look up the real definition, but you can’t because you're just a voice in ryker’s head.”*blocks out Arson’s voice so he has to sit all alone in ryker’s head.*
Arson: “ Cancer you suck.”
Dream: * starts laughing.* 
Cancer:”He’s mad isn’t he. Have fun in ryker’s head.”*laughs*
Arson: “ Ryker, can you do me a favor and punch Cancer in the face.” 
Ryker: “No Thanks.”
Arson: “ sorry but i wasn't asking.” * takes control and punches Cancer.* 
Cancer:*walks away while still listening in on arson’s conversation, ducks and hurls ryker over her shoulder and throws him.*”you really thought that I actually blocked you out.”*laughs*
Arson: “ no.” * trips Cancer and lights her on fire.* 
Cancer:*floats*”Fire doesn’t hurt me, I’ve already learned your powers, I did it with dream a while ago.”
Arson: * doesn't care because she's still on fire.* 
Cancer:”You're happy with anything that’s on fire aren’t you. Ohh well, makes it easier to change your mind later.”*floats off*
Arson: “ Can I light Reflections on fire?”
Dream: “ no.”
Arson: “ pleeeeeaaaasssse.’’
Dream: “ Eve says no.”
Arson: “ aww pleeeeaaasssseeee.”
Evelin: “ Ryker please retake control.” 
Cancer:*is still watching*
Ryker: “DO IT ARSON!”
Arson: “ yesssssss!” * begins lighting fires.*
Evelin: “ You're a bad influence!” * starts putting them out.*
Cancer:”they bring out the worst in eachother i would think.”
Evelin: “ you think?!” 
Cancer:”yes. I think.”
Dream: “ aw cumon. This is fun.” 
Arson: “ YEESSSSSS!!!!!!” 
Cancer:”Well that's because you're fire demons.”
Dream: “ mind demons actually.” 
Cancer:”mind demons that like fire.”
Dream: “ yup.”
Evelin: “ STAY FOCUSED!” * continues putting the fire out.*
Cancer:*summons a large amount of water and floods reflections.*
She can't because she's blocked. 
Cancer:”Evelin, unblock me.”
Ryker: “Fire is great.”
Evelin: “ a little busy right now.” * is fighting for control.*
Dream: “ stop!”
Evelin: “ NO!” 
Cancer:”let me in Dream.”*begins making her mirror make high pitched noises to hurt dreams ears*”Let me know when you're in control Evelin.”
Dream: * makes it so that Cancer can’t manipulate the mirror anymore.* “ NO!” 
Evelin: “ Let me stop this!” 
Dream: “ no! It's fun!” 
Ryker: “COME ON ARSON! BURN IT TO THE GROUND!”
Dream: “ That's impossible.”
Arson: “ aww.” 
Cancer:*takes hold of reflections*”let me in dream”*begins compressing it*
She can’t, she's blocked.
Ryker: “There is a whole area of SOUR that's under renovations, we can burn that down.”
Arson: “ yesss!” * teleports there and begins lighting fire.* 
Cancer:*blocks Arson*
Arson: * doesn't care.* “ FIRE!!!!”
Evelin: * puts out all the fire.* 
Cancer:*summons much water on Arson and removes the air around him.*
She can't. There in SOUR
Cancer:*is outside of sour. Begins compressing it*
She cant 
Cancer:”YOU CAN'T CONTROL ME!”*breaks the green text temporarily*
She can't. 
Cancer:*goes to Inbetween and blocks it off from all things including Reflections, begins altering it*
Dream: “ uhhh ok.’’ * goes back to reflections.*
Evelin: “ Why were you stopping cancer from putting out the fire?”
Dream: “ he can't hurt anything in reflections.”
Evelin: “ still. It's not good to have fire in Reflections.”
Dream: “ whatever. Hey  what's up with Willam and Rae?”* looks for them.*
Meanwhile,
William: * is in Raes' backpack.* 
Dream: “ hey!” 
Willam: “ wha- Dream? I thought you were kidnaped.’’
Dream: “ oh yeah. Well I'm back. Also Rykers like me now.”
William: “ what?”
Dream: “ he basically went back in time and switched himself out for me during the time of the experiment.”
William: “ Why?! That's a very foolish thing to do.”
Dream; “ I know. But I don't think he cares. Where's Rae.”
William; “ somewhere around here. She had stuff she had to take care of.”
Dream: “ oh ok.”
Inbetween
Cancer:*moves the Inbetween and some other random universe with it.*
Meanwhile
Arson: “ FIRE!!!!!!!!” * continues lighting stuff on fire.*
Jaeger: “Oh, hello Ryker I thought you were in trouble? Also, why are you trying to burn everything?”
Arson: “ because why not!” 
Ryker: “He won’t fall for that.”
Jaeger: “What did you do with Ryker?!” 
Arson: “ nothing! I am Ryker.” * mutters.* “ Well, kinda.”
Ryker: “Lies! Why are you lying to him?!”
Jaeger: “What do you mean Kinda?”
Arson: “ I’m not lying. I count as Ryker.” 
Ryker: *sarcastic* “Sure….”
Arson: * begins ignoring Ryker.* “ soooo. I obviously know you, right?”
Jaeger: “Yes, when did we first meet?” *Begins charging up energy blast*
Arson: “ uhh… I don’t know. I can’t remember.” * lights him on fire and runs.* 
Ryker: “Oh yeah. Real subtle.”
Jaeger: “Really!” *Flies next to him to keep up and fires energy blast* “I liked this outfit, and you are definitely not the Ryker I know!”
Ryker: “This is brilliant.”
Arson: “ Look, I’m just doing what he told me to do.” 
Ryker: “You’re just making this worse on yourself.”
Arson: “ you told me to tell people I was you!” * prepares to get shot.*
Ryker: “I told you to do that to ONE person, plus, my advice isn’t the best.”
Jaeger: “Wait, who are you talking to?”
Arson: “ Ryker.” * looks down.* “ also. Yeah! no kidding?!”  
Jaeger: “What do you mean you are talking to Ryker?”
Ryker: “Tell him idiot.”
Arson: “ Don’t call me an idiot!” * pauses.* “ I’m sorry. Could you repeat the question?” 
Jaeger: “What. Do. You. Mean. You. Are. Talking. To. Ryker.”
Arson: “ I’m Rykers split personality. So he can talk to me in my head. That’s also why I look and sound just like him.” 
Jaeger: “You’re going to need to elaborate. Ryker has many split personalities that I thought turned into E Ryker.”
Arson: “ oh I’m different from him. I’m new. I’m Arson.” 
Jaeger: “Makes sense, you like to light things on fire. Also, how were you formed if not through the splitter ray?”
Arson: “ I… actually don’t know.” 
Jaeger: “Why don’t you ask Ryker if you can talk to him.”
Arson: “ I can talk to him ALL the time.” 
Jaeger: “Alright then, why does Dream seem to dislike you?”
Arson: “ Dream doesn’t dislike me!” 
Jaeger: “Then Why does it seem whenever they are dealing with you they try to control you like an older sibling?”
Arson: “ That's Evelin trying to be responsible. I tend to like to burn stuff down if you couldn’t tell and apparently that's not a very good thing to do.”
Ryker: *sarcastic* “Really?”
Arson: * is ignoring him. Mumbles something.* 
In Nightfall
Radharc: “I think the time has come” *Grabs super old flip phone* “Now, how do I send texts, oh yes” *Sends message to Ryker, Jaeger, and Dream: “Meet me in nightfall Sector2 level -2000 room 208”* “Now” *Walks down to that room and waits*
Not all of these people need to be there, just one at least.
Dream: * teleports to nightfall.* “ yeah?”
Arson: * appears.* “ Oh hey Dream.” 
Radharc: “Arson, I mean okay, I am heading down to the lower levels and I need someone to come with me.” *Opens door and the room suddenly gets colder.* “Follow me” *Walks through  door*
Arson: “ Dream if I don't come back, send help.” * walks through the door.* 
When they step inside They see a large room and in the center there is A symbol that has a silver eye.
Radharc: “I knew they did not create that symbol! Have you seen this before?” 
Arson: “ ….noooo.” 
Radharc: “I am actually here for a slightly different reason, I have not been completely honest, I know what this place is, It is known as Knamaengard.”
Arson: “ ….. Goodbye.” * begins to walk away.*
Radharc: “RYKER!” *Pulls out ray and a strange frequency comes out and Arson loses control and Ryker is back in control* “You are in control for 24 hours, that is all I can get you!” 
Arson: “ aww man. You suck. And I don't even know who you are!”
Radharc: “LEAVE ARSON!”
Arson: “ I cant! I am literally stuck with Ryker.”
Radharc: “Ryker, I am here because I want to retrieve my lost memories, I was able to sense the tape with them it is down here, I put a tracker on them a few years ago and I need you here so that if we encounter, the thing, I will not be defenseless, I think I know where it is” *Begins to walk *
Gem raven:*appears outside door. Flies in and lands on radharc’s shoulder*”caw. Gem heart. caw.”
Arson: “ you do realize that i can be very annoying when i want to be sooo yeah.” 
Radharc: “It is in here” *Opens door*
The room is an old security room with monitors.
Radharc: “This is the tape” *Puts in tape*
Gem raven:*eyes glow cyan blue green, becomes stiff, and head turns to monitor.*
Arson: “ the end is never the end is never the end is never the end is never the end is never the end is never the end is never the end……” * This continues.*
The tape starts
Dr. Cannon: “Welcome to Knamangard, we are testing the frequency project”
Connor: “Are you ready Doctor”
Dr. Cannon: “I am just starting the video”
Dr. Allen: “All systems are ready to go”
Dr. Cannon: “Good, Anyways we have now figured out how to heal people with frequencies. Using this we can connect to the source of the universe and change that power to heal others”
Dr. Anna: “Sir, the frequency is seeing more interference the normal, it is still in range though”
Dr. Allen: “That is still fine”
Dr. Anna: “Connor enter the pod”
Connor: *Walks into pod*
Dr. Anna: “Starting in 3.2.1” *Starts device*
Dr. Allen: “Something is wrong, the frequency is changing”
Dr.Cannon: “SHUT IT DOWN!”
Dr. Anna: “I can’t! The reactor is not responding”
The pod glass begins to crack then it shatters
Connor: *Walks out*
When he does his eyes are glowing green
Connor: *Picks up cane*
When he does the cane changes from a blue to a dark Then a strange crackling sound comes and his face becomes hidden by dark scratches in the air
Connor: *Holds out hand and dark vines appear*
Dr. Cannon: “RUN!”
The vines come after him
Then the tape cuts to a later point
It is Dr. Cannon holding a small device
Dr.Cannon: “This is an update to the project, Connor has taken over the whole lab. I have completely sealed off the lab. I can not kill him. I have tried everything. But this, I can not kill him but I can maybe heal him. This device will separate his power and his thoughts. If I can do this then I can keep the world safe from him.”
It cuts again
Dr. Cannon: “It worked, his thoughts and power were separated. He split into two things. His thoughts formed a being named Radharc, His power on the other hand, It disappeared as a strange mist.” *Pauses* “It is still too dangerous to enter the area, a dark presence is still down there”
The tape ends
Radharc: “I am Connor!”
Gem raven:”you are connor! caww”*its eyes are still glowing*
When he says this the room get really cold and a strange mist begins to enter the room
Radharc: “NO! RUN” *Radharc collapse and his eyes begin to glow a bright green*
Gem raven:”caw. cold. “*Cancer's armor appears around the raven and the raven flees out of the hole, watches radharc, it looks to be expecting him to leave.*
Radharc: “He is coming” *Coughs*”Tell the council I have fallen, he is back the frequency is” *Coughs and begins to change*
Radharc Begins to change he then becomes younger and his clothes change to a suit and top hat then his cane is dark black again he then stands up and the air around his face then cracks and his face is not visible.
Ryker: “Here we go again…”
Gem raven:*flees and begins to look for the council. Deducts that it may be in what was sector 5 because that is where cancer couldn’t go.*
Sector 5
Gem raven:*armor vanishes*”cawwwww cawww. Heeee’s back. Frequencies cawww. The fallen. Cawww. Cawww.  ”
Àite: “Who? Where is radharc?”
Gem raven:”hole… cawww. Radharc top hat cawwww suit. 
Àite: “Connor?”
Gem raven:”you are connor!!!! cawwww”
Àite: “Wait, no, no, That means Conor is back.”
Gem raven:”radharc, Connor, one in the same. Cawwww.”
Àite: “He is coming, I can sense him, he is traveling through time to us, WE NEED TO GO!”
Gem raven:*gets super stiff, eyes glow even brighter, in cancers voice*”you may be able to come to the inbetween. I may be able to block it off for some time.”
Àite: “No, that is too close to a room, I am going to take the disk then I want you to take it to take it to [Redacted]”
Gem raven(cancer):”okay.”*does so*
Back in the hole
Ryker: “Well hello small child, I’m Ryker.”
Connor: *Holds out hand and vines begin to appear on the wall and a door opens then he sends a message to his head: “My power is back, you are not marked, you will make it.” walks through the door and leaves* 
Arson: “ soooo can we light stuff on fire now?”
Connor: *Appears in front of him and sends a message: ‘You are marked. Goodbye’ points at Arson and Arson inside of him begins to be pulled into a doorway. It draws arson out of him and Arson is sent to an unknown location.*
Ryker: “ARSON! AHHHHHHH”
Arson: “ RYKER!!!” 
Connor: *Speaks to his mind ‘I can not send Arson. You altered the marking, I have to send arson back after some time, you have made a powerful enemy’ Leaves.* 
Ryker: “Marking? Do you mean the timeline???”
Dream: *appears* “ What the heck happened??!! Where's Arson??!!!”
Ryker: “I…don’t know.”
Dream: “ YOU LOST ARSON?! How on earth do you lose your split personality?!” 
Ryker: “The same way you lose a shoe. Obviously.”
Dream: * shakes her head and mutters something.*
Cancer:*stops changing the inbetween and the other random universe to not draw attention, becomes a chair yet again and watches Connor*
Meanwhile
Arson: * looks different. He is a different person with jet black messy hair, red eyes and sharp teeth.*“ where am I?! Let me GO!” 
*No response*
Arson: * starts lighting stuff on fire.*
A sound Rings out in Rykers voice
Ryker: “Arson????”
Arson: “ Ryker?”
Ryker: “Yeah! It’s me! I think we’re still mentally linked in some way.”
Arson: “ Can you help me out? I’m trapped somewhere.” 
Ryker: “Where?”
Arson: * a little freaked out.* “ uhh I don’t know. I can’t see much.” 
Ryker: “I kinda need a location.”
Arson: * a little more freaked out.* “ uhhh I don’t know! I can’t see anything!” 
Ryker: “Well figure it out!”
Arson: “ How on earth am I supposed to do that?”
Ryker: “I don’t know man!”
Arson: “ Then what do we do?!”
Ryker: “I DON’T KNOW!!!”
Arson: * runs his hands through his hair in frustration.* “ Then do I just wait here?”  
Ryker: “I guess…unless you have any other ideas…”
Arson: “ I don’t know. I just want to get out of here!” 
Ryker: “Well I don’t know how to help.”
Arson: “ how long do I have to stay here?” 
Ryker: “How am I supposed to know?”
Arson: * freaked out.* “ I don’t know!” 
Ryker: “All we can do is wait then.”
Arson: “ dang it. I hate that word.” * pauses.* “ what if nothing happens and I’m just trapped here forever?” 
Ryker: “That would suck.”
Arson: * frustrated.* “ So then what do we do?!”
Ryker: “I don’t know!”
Arson: * sighs in frustration.* “ I can't just sit here! I think it's impossible for me!” 
Meanwhile 
Dream: “ I'm leaving. I don't like the feel of this place.” * goes back to reflections and begins looking at all sorts of different universes.*
Connor: *walks to reflection mirror *
PI: “Connor? What’s my brother doing here?!”
Pi is then disappeared because Present Author uses a remover card
Connor: *Sends a message to DREAM:”You have been marked Dream. I will find you!”*
Dream: “ oh no.” * closes off Reflections and does one of the most difficult things for her to do: sit in the center of reflections and stay quiet.*
Connor: *Sits down next to mirror and closes his eyes with his palms up*
Connor begins to try to tune to the Reflections; this could take some time.
Dream: * makes it so that only her own powers work in reflections.*
Connor: *Still looking*
Dream: * stays where she is.*
A small voice in dream says: “Dream, can you hear me, it’s Radharc.”
Dream: “ yeah i can hear you.”
It then says: “Good, how much control over the reflections do you have?”
Dream: “ I have total control.”
Then: “Good, he is getting close to your frequency, right before he connects I want you to change the frequency just slightly, this will confuse him.”
Dream: “ ok.”
Last: “NOW!”
Dream: * changes frequency.*
Connor: *Flinches and loses track.*
Dream: * sighs in relief.*
Author: * revives PI because why not.* 
PI: “Thank you.”
THE Author: “How many times do I have to get rid of you?” *deletes Pi*
Connor looks up and then opens up a doorway and leaves
Connor: *disappears.*
Dream: * slowly gets up and checks on more stuff.*
A small earthquake begins next to ryker then dark vines begin to wrap around the wall and a doorway appears and Arson is thrown out of the doorway.
Arson: “ finally! FREEDOM!!!” 
Ryker: “What! Why! Rude! Dream? I need a Little help here!”
Dream: “ yeah?”
Connor: *Sends message to mind: ‘WHAT!How did you fail the test that fast? I mean, it is not perfect but still only 36 hours?’*
Ryker: “I heard that. Wait…how did I hear that?”
Connor: *Looks up and there is a bright green flash then sends a message: “2 halves are made whole!” Points at Ryker and sends “Ryker, you are whole once more, you have lost your spot, you are not chosen.”*
Arson: “ ummmm we’re kinda not actually together anymore. We’re two separate beings.” 
Ryker: “I don’t think he was referring to that.”
Arson: “ oh.” 
Ryker: “Yeah. You should probably run or he’ll try to kidnap you again probably.”
Arson: “ Well if he takes me I’ll take you with me.” 
Ryker: “May I ask how?”
Arson: “ if I tell you, you’ll just stop me.” 
Ryker: “Fair.“
Arson: “ yeah.” 
Dream: “ Wait, why’d you call me if you didn’t NEED me?” 
Connor: *points at dream: “YOU HAVE BEEN CHOSEN DREAM GOOD BYE” she is sent to a room*
Dream: “ wha-? Hey! Let me go!” 
Ryker: “Oh boy.” *begins typing on his phone*
Arson: “ oh nein.” 
In the place
The room is a large room with a lock box
Dream: * walks through the wall.* 
It fails there is no power there
Ryker: *suddenly appears in the room*
It fails and he is sent out
Connor: “Do not interact with a test!”
Dream: “ uhhhhhhhh. Can I go?” 
Meanwhile
Ryker: “Hey Arson, this is random, but do you share a neural link with Dream?”
Arson: “ I don’t know.” 
Ryker: “Can you try?”
Arson: “ yeah I think I have a mental link.” 
Connor: *Appears and sends: “Ryker, would you like to take her place? If you want to see it so bad you can see it”*
Ryker: “I’ll take her place. I’ve got no purpose to live.”
Arson: “ but I might die!” 
Connor:*Sends:”DONE!” His eyes glow green: “You have been chosen! Switch in 5, 4, 3, 2, 1 Now”*
Ryker switches places with DREAM
Dream: “ whoa! What happened?”
Arson: “ Ryker took your place.”
Dream: “ Why?!” 
Connor: *Looks at DREAM and sends: “Good job, thank you for your help, good bye.” Leaves*
Dream: “ oh my- why did he do that?!”
Arson: * shrugs.* “ I dunno. But I think if he dies I die.” 
Meanwhile
Ryker is in a room with a lock box in the center of the room
Ryker: *attempts to pick the lock*
Connor: *Chuckles* “No no, here is your first clue” *paper appears* 
It reads: “Feed me and I shall thrive, give me drink and I shall die.”
Ryker: “Fire.”
The room shifts
Ryker: “What's next?”
Connor: “What, no how, sorry next find your way through  the mental maze”
Ryker sees a room with codes all over the walls In the center of the room there is an old looking keypad then on one of the walls there is a inscription saying “What Rises must:________”
Ryker: “Fall.”
Connor: “The keypad seems useful.”
Ryker: *types Fall on the keypad*
A small eyeglass comes out of a compartment with a strange lens
Ryker: “How many of these lame puzzles are there?”
Connor: “Use the lens!” 
Ryker: *snatches lens and snaps it*
It fixes itself
Ryker: “Fine.” *puts on glasses*
He then sees Connor
Ryker: “Hey?”
Connor: “NO, you have ruined my test GET OUT!”
Ryker: “What’d I do?”
Ryker is out of the test because he failed
Ryker: “I don’t get it.”
Arson: “ Welcome back.” 
Ryker: “Thanks?”
Dream: “ sooo did you fail or…” 
Ryker: “I guess. I’m not really sure why.”
Arson: * suddenly begins lighting stuff on fire.*
Ryker: “What are you doing?!”
Arson: * doesn't answer. He just keeps lighting fires.* 
Ryker: “What are you doing!”
Arson: * still doesn’t answer. He continues to add fire.* 
Ryker: “ARSON!”
Arson: * there is no answer. He keeps lighting fires.* 
Ryker: *smacks Arson*
Arson: * doesn't seem to notice, just keeps lighting fires.* 
Ryker: *puts out some fires*
Arson: * just sets more fire.* 
Cancer:*is watching*
The fire begins to form into the words Cursed Minds Never Die
Inbetween
Cancer:*makes mist in the inbetween* 
Back to wherever the rest of them are
Ryker: “…are you okay?” *waits* “ARSON!” *tries to go into Arsons mind.”
He can’t
Arson: * continues lighting fires.* 
Ryker: *puts Arson in a ring of salt*
Arson: * passes through somehow. Continues to light fires.* 
Inbetween
Cancer:*bonds the Inbetween to all of the gem beings*
Gem beings:*continue doing what they’ve been doing because they don’t know anything’s changed*
Back to Ryker and Arson
Ryker: *sighs* “I’m going to regret this.” *pulls out splitter ray, reverses its polarity and shoots both of them to combine them back together.*
He can’t.
Ryker: “DREAM! I NEED SOME HELP! ARSON’S GOING NUTS!” 
Dream: * gives him a weird look.* “ uhhh, he seems perfectly fine to me.” 
Ryker: “He isn’t. Look at what the fire’s spelling, and he’s not responding to anything.”
Dream: * shakes her head.* “ The fire isn’t spelling anything.”
Ryker: “Look. It’s spelling Cursed Minds Never Die.”
Dream: * gives him an odd look.* “ …. No it doesn’t.”
Ryker: “LOOK AT IT!!!! Or at least…I saw it.”
Dream: “ I’m looking! It’s just fire! Everything is fine!” 
Ryker: “I’m not insane.”
Dream: “ yeah but I’m telling you I don’t see anything bad happening.”
Ryker: “Well that makes it worse. I even tried stopping him with salt and it didn’t work.”
Dream: “ I don’t see why you need to stop him.”
Ryker: “I mean he’s burning stuff, which is fine, but he isn’t responding or anything.”
Dream: “ your point?”
Ryker: “Something’s not right. I need someone to help me fix it.”
Dream: “ Everything's fine. Nothing needs fixing!” 
Ryker: “Right.”
The large booming voice of Wiziker can be heard 
Wiziker:  “You should end it now.”
Ryker (Original): “But it just got interesting.”
Wiziker: “Fair, but look what happened to you, you became weak.”
Ryker (original): “I did that on purpose, it’s fun to experiment. And the Rae character…fascinating. It would be interesting to actually meet her.
Wiziker: “I doubt I'm as evil as this makes me seem.”
Ryker (Original): “You really think I should shut it down?”
Wiziker: “I do.”
Ryker: “Maybe if we removed the strawberry milk incident…and the characters involved…”
Wiziker: “Hey, why’s the light blinking?”
Ryker: “Crap! I left it on!”
It ends.
Arson: “ whoa. What in the multiverse just happened?”
Dream: “ i dont know.”
Ryker: “...Excuse me what!”
Doesn't seem to be able to hear him. The fire is gone. 
Ryker: “Arson?”
THE Author: *clears throat* “Wow. That was weird. It's like I planned something.”
Ryker: “Author. What did you do?”
THE Author: “Nothing.”
Ryker: “Right.”
Arson: “ do you think it has anything to do with Ryker and that test thing?’’
Dream: “ maybe.”
Ryker: “No. It doesn’t. The Author is subtly telling us something.”
THE Author: “No.”
Ryker: “Right. I have a theory. We’re in a simulation.”
They don’t seem to be able to hear him
Arson: “ he should have been back by now. Do you think he's in trouble?”
Dream: “ No. You said that you two are connected. I think something would happen to you if he was in trouble.” 
Author: * revives PI again because she's bored.*
Dream: “ Wait Pi?” 
Arson: “ who?”
PI:”I am 3.1415926…”
This goes on for a while
Arson: “ Who is this?”
Dream: “ this is Pi. he has been banned from pretty much everywhere multiple times. “ 
Ryker suddenly wakes up back where Arson is burning everything.
All of a sudden fire begins to form a symbol around Ryker and the fire consumes him.
Ryker wakes up in a room full of white boards with strange symbols and math equations so complex that one single equation takes up a whole wall a man that looks strangely familiar looks up from An equation
Ryker: “Oh great.”
???: “Who are you?”
Ryker: “YOU! From the future!”
???: “Do not lie, I can not have a future”
Ryker: “Idk.”
???: “Anyways, while you are here can you help me with this equation?”
Ryker: “What?”
???: “I know just as much as you, some guy came up to me and said “You have been chosen” then I did some tests, he said I failed then I was in a large fire now I am here.”
Ryker: “Excuse me while I go.” *teleports away and fails*
Connor: “You wouldn’t want it to end so soon would you? No, no, no, this is only just getting good.”
Ryker: “So can I go now?”
Connor: “You have made another Ryker, you can not take it back, you will complete the test or you will break, you can not leave though.”
Ryker: “Dang, I didn’t understand any of that.” 
Connor: “Continue the test, or you will break.”
Ryker: “Okay. I thought I failed.”
Cancer:*watching, is concerned because ryker does stupid stuff all the time and if he breaks they should all be thrown out into the real world*
Meanwhile
Arson: * burns identical to any burns Ryker got appear on his skin.* “ wha- HOW?!”
Dream: “ what?”
Arson: * shows her burns. freaked out* “ I'm immune to fire!! How is this possible?!” 
Dream: * shrugs.* 
Back before Jaeger had entered the Multiverse and when he had just recently gained his powers
Jaeger: “Now that I have powers I can finally fulfill my dreams and become a hero! I cannot wait to help people!”
After becoming a hero Jaeger starts out rough but starts to get the hang of being a hero, but unfortunately he is the only person who gained powers who decided to be a hero and not rob a bank every 5 seconds. . After successfully stopping some villains they all start to gang up and Jaeger and we are now at the point where he has been captured and will be sent flying throughout the multiverse. He is soon hated by the people for being a hero and soon after the people reach their limit and are cheering for his capture.
Jaeger: “I suppose now that I have been captured I will be captured in a prison.”
Villain 1: “Now, after finding out that one of us has the power to scatter someone across the cosmos, supposedly killing them, even you.”
Villain 2: “We will give you one last option, go into retirement and stop being a hero and help us, or be scattered.”
Jaeger: “I will never join you but you are right, I am done being a hero.”
The People: “Yeah! Scatter him! We hate him, you guys are so much better!”
Jaeger: “See, there is no point in being  a hero anymore.”
Villain with power previously mentioned: “Fine then, goodbye Jaeger, you will not be missed.” *Jaeger is then shoved in a dimensional rift made by the villain*
Jaeger: *Is then scattered and floats around throughout the multiverse² without anyone to talk to and eventually his brain shuts down, seemingly dying until he manages to stabilize and bumps into a being named Radharc in a place called Nightfall.*
Unbeknownst to all, this was not by coincidence. Ryker, in a fit of boredom, simply pushed him toward Nightfall, curious about what would occur.
In Current Era
Dream: “ Do you think we should go save Ryker?”
Arson: * contemplates his burns.* “ naaa. I’m going to light some fires!” * does so.*
Dream: * shrugs and joins in.* “ PK FIRE!!” 
Arson: “ PK FIRE!!!” * shoots a ball of fire.* 
The fire's tint becomes almost dark green for a split second, and then reverts to its red-orange.
Dream: “ time to go.” * takes them both back to reflections and puts the fire out.* 
Arson: ‘ HEY! What was that for?!” 
Evellin: “ chill. It's just fire.” 
Arson: * gasps.* “ wha- how could you say that?!”
Evelin: “ It's true.”
Arson: “ You're dead to me!!!” 
Dream: “ Am I dead to you?”
Arson: “ I suppose not.”
A dead strawberry milk cow appears on the floor for a second, then disappears
Arson: “ what in the-?”
Dream: “ ohhhhhh thats a suuuuuppppeeeerrr old reference.” 
A quiet thud can be heard.
Arson: “ ohhhhhh. Something to light on fire.” 
Evelin: “ Arson no.”
Arson: * glares at her.* “ Try and stop me.”
Evelin: “ gladly.” * traps him in a circle of salt.*
Arson: “ dang it.” * tries and fails to break free.* “ Ryker HELP!!!”
Dream: “ what are you doing?”
Arson: “ hoping that Ryker can help.” 
Dream: “ he can't hear you!”
Arson: “ how do you know?”
Rykers currently trapped, remember?
A ram’s skull appears for a second and then vanishes
Dream: “ no.” * slays random Ram skull.*
R.I.P
Skull is already dead
Still R.I.P 
Ok
Back to Ryker 
Ryker!!! This is important. 
Ryker: “Green text?”
There is someone in your group that you can't trust. 
Ryker: “No dur Merlock.”
*eye roll.* no i mean someone you thought you could trust, lets just say has something interesting going on.
Ryker: “Like Dream?”
I can't tell you. No spoilers. :)
Ryker: “Great.”
Just beware. Also don’t tell the Authors I told you this. 
THE Author: *clears throat*
Author: “ wow. Just wow.”  
Athor:”We can see everything that you do.”
Dang it. 
Author: “ you know your job. Stop spoiling!” 
Athor:”Just state what is going on and what is happening, stop spoiling, as Author said.”
THE Author: “WELL EXCUUUUUUUUUSEEEEEEEE ME PRINCESSSSSSS.”
What? 
Athor:”WEEEEELLLLLLLLLL EXCUUUUUUUUUUUUUUSSSSSSSEEEEEEEEEEEEEE  ME  PRINCESSSSSSSS.”


Ummm ok? Hey Ryker, do you want more spoilers?
Ryker: “I mean…”
Author: “ don't you dare!!”
I'm joking. 
Ryker: “Dang.”
Athor:”Yeah, You better not spoil anything, we'll have to like, reset you.”
Meanwhile
The room ryker is in begins to shift and he then appears in a different room full of different pieces of music playing all at once
Connor: “Sorry, the fools known as Dream and Arson started damaging me… I mean the test.”
Ryker: “Is that the wii theme?”
Connor: “You must decipher the notes into the home song, good luck.”
Ryker: “All right, GLaDOS.” *pauses* “What’s the home song?”
Connor: *Begins to start shaking* “No.o.ooo” *Shifts to Radharc* “IT WORKED, I only have a few minutes, you have to get out of here as fast as you can, The whole place is under attack, thanks to arson, if he is destroyed, you will also fall, this place if you can not tell is all one computer”
Ryker: “Fall?”
Connor(Radharc): “Die, disappear, go away, your mind scape is in a computer in bound, but arson is burning bound, I am currently fighting it off, this room can change everything, the home song is a”
Ryker: “Right. Okay. Great. I’ll leave. He’s annoying anyways.” *teleports away and fails*
Connor(Radharc): “It does not work like that, I have tried to leave here, The home song as I was saying is someone's theme, depending on what you change it to will depend on what the next test is, do you know yours?”
Ryker: “Theme. So like the one the author wrote. Yeah I know my theme.” *plays it*
The room shifts to a strange place, it looks similar to the lab where ryker was created.
Connor(Radharc): “This is your mind scape, you are in control here, you need to find a way out, I also forgot to say, This room is also controlled by scientist, you need to gain full control.”
Ryker: “Exit…yeah yeah…” *walks into small pod in the lab and closes it* “It’ll work again.” *enables lever, and a small pedestal glows*
Scientist: “Ryker, now, now, now, you did not think you would get out that fast did you!”
Ryker: “Oh I’m so scared of you. Save me…ahhhhhhhh. Oh wait. You’re just annoying. Leave. I’m done dealing with you.”
Scientist: “Except, you are frightened by me, or are you.” *Pulls out strange sword and throws one to him*
Ryker: “I’m not. You can’t kill me.” *avoids sword*
Connor(Radharc): “Yah, I forgot to say, he is kind of just as powerful as you in here, that is not actually scientist, that is an embodiment of the other that control you, you must fight them off to leave the test, this was the one lock I could not bypass”
Ryker: “Yeah, but I don’t care. That’s something he doesn’t have. And I don’t know. That’s how I beat them. He wouldn’t put me against people equal to my power if he wanted to fight me. I’m gonna stand here. He can’t do anything.”
The test begins to become pixelated and Connor lifts into the air.
Connor: “Whatt,t.t.t.ttt did you say! No, that is not a choice errrrorrr nnooonnooo”
Ryker: *chuckles* “I don’t care.”
Connor: “Yoouuu could hhaavvee hadd it all, Whyyyyyy, you do not want to stop me, I have your back upppp uppuppp.”
Ryker: “I already have it all. And that’s why I don’t have anything.”
Connor: *Shifts into a strange looking bot* “I will nototttt staannnddd for thththis! Yyyyyoou will falllalll” *Pauses* “If Iiii gooo dddown youu will fall with meee”
Ryker: “Neither will I.” *sits down* “I’m done.”
Ax21Rad: “Nonooo, how diddd you…”
Connor: “Ax21, I am done with you, you promised that if I gave you Ryker you would heal me.”
Ax21Rad: “You thought that I would actually help you.”
Ryker: “Heal you? I can do that nerd. Just let me go.”
Connor: “Follow me, Ax21 has no control over me” *Opens door way*
Ryker: “All right.” *follows him*
They appear in a room full of computers, there was clearly a fire in part of it,
Connor: “That was not me in the test, This is Ax21Rad, My biggest mistake, now, I can finally shut him down, He broke his contract with me, so he must fall” *Plugs in a USB with an AI built into it* “This was one of Jake's greatest creations, A device so smart that it could challenge him.”
The intercom speakers come on, “Emergency Ax21Rad security protocol recommends you unplug the device for safety reasons.”
Connor: “OVERRIDE”
Intercom: “Please enter the root password.”
Ax21Rad: “NO!”
Intercom: “Stalemate Detected, please wait for a stalemate Associate.”
Connor: “I am correct, allow me, root password Ax.,//1!2fjajeick$er%#;fjrhr38ajggj:”}\|z”
Intercom: “Starting override.”
Ax21Rad: “No…” *pauses* “Wait, what, stop it!, do youoouu knnnow what she cccan do to this place!”
The computer screen begins to change and a new voice begin to come threw the speakers
???: “It’s been along time.” *pauses* “now to deal with this lesser device” *Begins to try to overload Ax21*
Ax21Rad: “I do not think so!” *Begins to overload the other AI*
Connor: “NO! If he overloads her, we are all doomed.”
Intercom: “Device Overload, beginning reset of all devices.”
Connor: “STOP, no…”
The device is reset and the Emergency protocol is stoped.
Ax21Rad: “NOW there is nothing you can do to…” *Pauses* “What are you doing.”
Ryker: “I’ve got my own AI…try this.” *hands small hard drive to Connor*
Connor: “Goodbye, Ax21, you are my biggest mistake!” *Plugs in the drive*
There appears to be a small fizzle and a pop. A voice is then heard
???: *masculine* “Is that all?”
Connor: “I do not recognize this AI, what is it?”
Ryker: “I call him Frank. He’s a mix of most every AI I’ve encountered across the multiverse.”
???: “I prefer to be called Jeffrey.”
Connor: “Okay, Jeffrey, could you remove the remaining pieces of Ax21?”
Jeffery: “Already done. What do you think I am? A second rate AI like him?”
Then one of the devices on the wall lights up
Ax21Rad: “IF I GO DOWN YOU WILL TOO!” *a small device points at Connor and he collapses.*
Jeffrey: “Reloading sequence. Please stand by….”
Connor begins to raise into the air and a strange sound comes out of him like all of the frequencies in the multivers collapsing, Connor falls back down and looks like Radharc
Radharc: “NO, connor, WHAT DID YOU DO!”
Ryker: “He must have deleted him.”
Device: “I removed him.”
A large tremor begins starting in the basement of nightfall.
Ryker: “See.”
Radharc: *Begins to cough* “We need to get out of here, he also killed the power inside of connor, only he new the right frequency the pocket realm is collapsing from the inside out.”
The walls in night fall begin to collapse into hexagons
Ryker: *sighs* “All right. Another universe is collapsing.” *opens a portal* “Jeffrey, area code 54B. All right?”
Jeffrey: *slowly running out of power* “Of course siiiiiir…”
Night fall begins to start burning
Radharc: “The Generator must be on fire, we need to get out of here fast, this place is about to…”
Ryker: *steps through portal.* “Come on. Don’t worry about Jeffrey. He can handle it.”
Radharc: *Runs thru the portal.*
When they get to the other side they hear a loud sound almost like shattering glass, it can be heard from all over the multiverse.
Ryker: “Now…” *suddenly Jeffrey is heard from Rykers backpack*
Jeffrey: “All right. All systems are downloaded and the facility is mapped, awaiting port location.”
Radharc: *Smiles* “ I wondered what it was doing.”
Ryker: “I can plug the facility into SOUR if you want. It could come in handy so this kinda stuff doesn’t happen again.”
Radharc: “That would work perfectly.” *Coughs*
Ryker: “Great.” *to Jeffrey* “Protocol 56Z, location F.”
A small door appears in the area of SOUR, standing in the middle of the room
Ryker: “There ya go.”
Radharc: *Coughs* “There, now it won’t be deleted. Speaking of witch, we should probably check on dream, the old night fall was tied to the same frequency of…” *Coughs* “The reflections.”
Ryker: “You should probably stay here. I’ve got a bad feeling that something’s about to happen…in fact…”
Hestuia: *appears* “Oh! Finally. It took long enough. Now you should probably bring everyone you care about to SOUR…or they’ll all die. See ya soon losers.” *Hestuia begins chuckling and stabs himself in the throat, killing himself*
Radharc: “Oh no, that does not sound too good” *Sarcastically says* “That is not at all frightening.”
Ryker: “I would be quite afraid.”
Ryker (Original) Voice: “Oh y’all should be very afraid…”
Ryker: “Did you hear that!?!?”
Radharc: *Goes pale* “n,nno, how is he, yes I am afraid I did”
Ryker: “Are you ready for ROUND 2?” *chuckles*
Radharc: “Realy, already, okay.”
Ryker: “This isn’t round two…is it?”
Ryker: “I would call it Round 547, in full honesty. I’ve gotten so bored here. I love destruction.” *pauses* “Wiziker. Begin archiving all data.”
Wiziker: “Of course.”
Ryker: “Archiving data?” *looks at Radharc* “What!?!?”
Present Author: “Here we go again. Part 3 is ending then?”
The Author: “Oh yes it is…but before we end….”
Out of thin air, as if bursting through a hole, a figure stands, cloaked in shadow, holding a staff. 
???: *distorted voice* “Where…am I?”
Present Author: “I call last word!”
The Author: “The last word is mine and mine alone.”
End Of Part 3
