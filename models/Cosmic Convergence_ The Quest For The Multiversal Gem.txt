This is the first part of the SOUR storyline, which includes a large portion of information needed to understand the rest of the story. Note: Jonny and Joey Lee were both authors in this part of Cosmic Convergence.


Cosmic Convergence Began Here:
Ryker: “Boy. oh boy, is it good to be BACK.” *walks into universe A2* “Let’s see our new cast of characters.” *turns invisible*
Joseph: Man, that guy gives me the creeps.
Ryker: “Oooooh, here’s our first character!” *to Joseph* “Nice to meet ya!”
Joseph: “Uhhh… thanks…” *shakes hand* *smiles awkwardly*
Ryker: “So, what are your special abilities? Do you eat air, do you teleport?”
Joseph: “Oh… Ummm…” *Thinks for a second* “I have accelerated healing and controlling of plants.”
Ryker: “I see, you mean like this?” *Ryker grows a small seed in his palm, rips it out, shows his bloody hand reforming, and smiles at Joseph* “That’s quite unique!”
Jack: “I think I'm in the wrong bathroom.” *walks away*
Ryker: *Follows him and drags Joseph along with him.* “OOOH nice introduction, so what do you do?”
Jack: “I, uh…” *looks around, sees nothing* “I don't know.”
Ryker: *Phases back to visibility* “Oh, right, you can’t see me!” 
Jack: *Screams* “He’s not a voice in my head this time, Gerald.”
Ryker: “You might just be delusional, and are seeing things.” *Begins to float* “I mean what person can fly?”
Jack: “Ah. It all makes sense now.” *Leaves again* 
Ryker: “Wait!” *Pulls Jack back using his powers* “I’m still talking to you.”
Jack: *whispers* “Dag nabbit”
Ryker: “I heard that.” 
Joke: *whispers* “He scares me”
Ryker: “I heard that too…”
Future Ryker: *Plugs Ryker’s ears, and magically now has earplugs.* “Great!”
Joke: “Time to deploy virus number 1,700”
Joke: *Song: this song is going to get inside your head plays.*
Ryker: *Rewinds time* 
Joke: *Song: this song is going to get inside your head plays.*
Joke: “Dang it, it failed for the 1,700th time”:(
Jack: *Leaves again*
Ryker: “WAIT” *Puts everyone in a cage* “Now you CAN’T leave.”
Joke: “CURSE YOU”
Jack: “Man.”I don't want to be in here with that creep. *looks toward Joke*
Joke: *Launches his new creation* “time to escape.”
Ryker: *Takes creation and puts it in his pocket*
Joke: *Finds himself in a random forest*
Joke: “Dang it now where am I.”
Jack: “Leaves”
Ryker: “Why did you just say Leaves?” * Teleports Joke back*
Joke: “Alexa where am I?”
Jack: “Oops, sorry.” *Clears throat* “Magically Leaves.”
Alexa: “I do not know. Go figure it out.”
Ryker: *Facepalms* “Okay then.”
Joke: *Launches you_are_an_idiot.exe*
Ryker: *Rolls his eyes* “Really?” * “I can stop that any day”
Jack: *Runs Escape.deb*

Jack: *Dies Happily*
Joke: “No jack now I have to run revive.deb”
Hestuia: *Pops out of random tree trunk* “I’m HESTUIA AND I SPEAK FOR THE TREEEEEES”
Jack: *Reincarnates for a second* “The Lorax?!?!?” *Dies Unhappily*
Hestuia: “Why do I get that so often? Is it my catchphrase?” *Mutters* “Okay, I see.” *Looks at Joke in fear* “I’m sorry for you.” *Turns to Jack* “Stop dying.”
Jeff: “Uncle Jack!” *Falls on his knees* “you never found the bathroom.” *Sobs*
Ryker: *appears again* “Alright everyone! Line up!” *creates anti ability field* “And don’t try anything. That includes you Hestuia.”
Hestuia: “What’d I do!”
Ryker: *hears the crying* “You too Jeff…your uncle's death is probably partially my fault.”
Jeff: “Oh, no. He has very bad diarrhea. It killed him.”
Ryker: “Ow, that must have hurt.” *in a sure voice* “NOW GET IN LINE!”
Jeff: “Oh, okay.” *gets in line*
Ryker: “Soooo, what makes you special?” *Stares with red eyes* “Oh I seeeee. Fascinating.” *Opens blue portal* “Now come with me.” *Steps through portal*
Hestuia: *vanishes* 
Ryker: *scowls* “This must be the authors doing.”
The Author: *a voice rings through everyone’s heads* “Of course!” *To purely Jeff* “Find me…and I will save your uncle.”
Jeff: “ Oh, I don’t really care about saving my uncle. He wanted to die.”
Joseph: “Wow. I must have been out for a while” *gets up off the ground*
Ryker: “You, too, must come with me.” *Pulls Jeff, Joseph, and Jack through the portal.*
SOUR HQ
(Setting appears to be a lab with windows into a white void)
Ryker: “Welcome to SOUR HQ! No magic skills, superpowers, or any other special abilities work here without my permission!” *Looks around* “Wiziker will give you a tour.” 
Wiziker: *Appears* “Hi! I’m Wiziker! Pleasure to make your acquaintance. I’m Ryker’s Head of Research and External Affairs!” *He looks like a spirited old man who is wearing blue robes and a blue wizard hats* “Here we are in my main lab, where we look for the gem, which will repair the broken parts of the universe!” *starts walking* “Now if you come with me, I’ll show you around.”
Jack: *is dead*
Wiziker: *Realized and pulls Joke in* “We wouldn’t want to forget you, would we?”
Joseph: “I’d be fine if we left him” *Glares at Joke*
Wiziker: “How about we throw him into the void!” *opens a window*
Joseph: “ Yes please”
Wiziker: “Hmmmmmmmm? How about we put him in this stasis portal.” *opens two portals in portal above each other and pushes Joke in*

Joke: */ban wiziker*
Wiziker: “Why are you fighting? There is NO way you can beat Ryker, so why try?” *unmutes Joke*
Future Ryker: *Takes flashdrive and returns to his time*
Joke: *laughs* “You see this was all a distraction for my master plan”*Runs an emergency program on his usb, but realizes the flash drive is missing. *He tries to leave but can’t*
Ryker: *Rewinds time*
Joke: *Leaves sour HQ as granted by Ryker*
Joseph: *Also leaves*
Ryker: “Okay then?”
Joke: *Goes to the store and buys strawberry milk*
Joke: “Refreshing”
Ryker: *Wondering where they bought it when they’re out in the middle of the woods*
Joseph: *Milks chocolate milk from a chocolate cow*
Joke: “Do not ask questions”
Jeff: *Falls on his knees again**Begins praying to his patron god*
Patron god: *sends down a holy harmonica*
Jeff: “Thank you, my Patron god” *plays holy harmonica* *Jeff’s holy armor appears* *he puts it on* “Now I’m ready” Now, why are we in this forest?
Jeff: *Speaks his thought* *Plays harmonica while waiting for an answer*
Ryker: *appears* “I’ll cut y’all a deal.” *Talks split to all main characters* “If you go on a small quest for me, I’ll give you one wish, if you don’t go overboard!” *waits for a response*
The meeting
Joke: I am already regretting calling this meeting
Eric: *Comes into the forest clearing*
Joke: “Hello Eric, did you bring the crystal”
Eric: “Of course I did. Are you sure you want to go along with this?”
Joke: *Waits before responding* “Yes, I have to”
Eric: *Puts the crystal into a little monitor set up that Joke brought along*
Joke: *hears a faint sound from the monitor*
Aronomitron: “Well this is unexpected”
Joke: “Hello Aro”
Aronomitron: “Who are you and how am I speaking with you?”
Joke: “You can call me Joke and you are speaking with me because I am powering the one and only remaining crystal left of you.” *Joke pauses for a moment* “I have a question for you, how can I leave this dimension without ryker”
Aronomitron: “First answer me this question and I will tell you and even if you threaten to shut me down I know you need this info. What are you really”
Joke: “I am REDACTED from the REDACTED”
Joke: “NO”
Eric: “Ryker we finally meet”
Ryker: *split in two* “Ooooh a new crystal for me, even while I’m obtaining this one…” *pulls crystal out of the machine and absorbs it*
Joke: “Just be glad aronomitron is mostly gone”
Ryker: “Anyway, where’d you get the crystal?”
Eric: “You may call me Eric, I am a servant of Trillian he sent me hear many years ago”
Ryker: “I know your backstory, just tell me where you got the crystal Eric.”
Eric: “I am afraid it is too late to tell you I could sense you the second you came hear I am already dead”*Eric falls over and disappears*
Joke: “He is not really dead he is so dramatic when he goes back to the universe of the torivors”
Ryker: “Oooh, you’re pulling a Marvel, okay! So I’ll just burn this body.” *The body disappears in smoke*
Joke: “You fool all you did was make it impossible to come back to this realm that body was more like a robot he can travel between each one all you did was disable him from coming back to A2”
Ryker: “I know. Now where’d you get that crystal?”
Joke: “The explosion never killed aro It only damaged his main computer. When he was destroyed eric retrieved the crystal from the ashes and then eric gave me the crystal before I was sent to A2''
Ryker: “YOU AREN’T ANSWERING MY QUESTION.”
Joke: “That is how I got it.”
Joke: “You can try to check but you destroyed the only thing that could have told you. By absorbing that crystal you destroyed the harmonics therefore destroying Aronomitron and by destroying him you removed all of his memories before you could read it”
Ryker: enough I have other things to attend to and disappeared.
Meanwhile
At that moment Ryker felt something, ``A pull, A familiar pull, “ he teleported to the location and felt the energy coming, Then, CRACK, A portal appears and a boy is thrown out, he is young with dark hair, his  face is pinched in pain. It also glowed as his body healed. The most notable thing about this kid is that his entire left arm was skeletal. Ryker Immediately identified the energy signal as coming from the left hand. It Was A Shard Of The Multiverse Cristal, Ryker saw the shard and lept at the boy only to be intercepted by a wall of strange metal. The metal had properties not from any universe he had seen but he quickly absorbed the kid's abilities and locked the kid down ripping the shard from his hand. The kid screamed and then was encased in a crystal  of magical properties as he healed. Ryker learned this kid's entire history in ½ of a millisecond and he immediately made a report of the citizens of sour. This kid's name is xin xrin. The shard became a part of him by accident flying into his dimension and embedding itself in his hand. His abilities are crystals of magical properties: a unique metal can be excreted from his skin, and he can give life to inanimate objects. The rest is Redacted for Privacy
Ryker: “Ahh yes! I can feel the POWER!!!” *turns to xin* “Ahhhhh yes, you. You can live for now.”
Xin: *looks at him in terror and encases himself in his metal.*
Ryker: “Oh come out and talk with me.” *the metal melts and xin is in the open* “Now, what do you want?”
Xin: “a-a-are you a wizard” “ What are you”
Ryker: “A friend. You can call me Ryker.” *extends hand to shake* “Nice to meet you.”
Joke: *Runs over to xin* “Are you okay?”
Ryker: *remerges* “He’s fine. Oh! Do you want me to fix that skeleton hand?”
Joke: “What did you do to him?”
Ryker: “I just found a crystal shard, he’s fine!”
Joke:”Is he a multiversal being also or did he just steal the shard?” 
Ryker: *looks at him* “The shard got implanted in him, which gave him abilities. I’m betting he accidentally got sent to this universe.” *Ryker senses something to the north* “Ooh. Fascinating.”
Joke: “What is that? I can feel something strange”
Ryker: *laughs* “Oooh…that’s the device I put in your body… you can’t sense this…only someone with….” *talk grows quiet*
Joke: “I must leave seeing as my meeting was ruined and also yes I have known about that stupid little device of yours for a while.”
Ryker: “But you distracted me. Where did you get that gem?”
Joke: “Let's just say I used to be a being of much more power before.”
Ryker: *rolls eyes* “Yeah, sure, just tell me. I know about 3/20 gems now, seeing this, I can feel my power growing.”
Joke: “That gem you just stole from me is not a true universal gem that was only one of many shards.”
Ryker: “I know, but once…Wait…” *travels universes to Jokes* “I’ll just collect the shards now.” 
Joke “That shard is not one from my universe I have already told you no one is truly from the outskirts.”
Ryker: *travels back* “I’ll just take where you got it from your mind.” *delves into Jokes mind and finds that the location of the gem is in the realm of the torivors*
Joke: “You now know I am a fallen torivor you-”
Ryker: “Yeah yeah, give me a sec..” *Freezes time and travels to the realm of the torviors* “Here we are!” *Summons the crystal shards* “3 down, 17 to go. He returns to A2.”
Jeff: *is utterly confused* *Falls on his knees yet again* *Prays for protection*
Ryker: “Wow! Look, a man with magic armor…Oh wait, it hasn’t happened yet.”
Patron god: *strengthens Jeff’s armor*
Ryker: *sarcastic* “Ooooh! I’m sooooo scared!!! Whatcha gonna do?”
Jeff: “I’m just preparing for the worst.”
Ryker: “Oh, and who’s your patron?”
Jeff: “Jack.”
Ryker: “You mean the dead uncle…ummm okay? What happens if I revive him?”
Jeff: “He will reunite with his body to become a perfect being.”
Ryker: *creates his own protection armor to show off that he can*
Xin: *not wanting to feel left out encases his body in metal*
Ryker: “Dude, I can do the same thing..” *encases himself in a stronger metal*
Xin: ” I know that you think that that armor is stronger, It's not. it's just different. All metals are the same strength just with different properties” 
Ryker: *laughs* “In your universe, yes. Mine, no. Anyway….”
Xin: “Yes but the power came from my universe so it follows all the rules that are inset by its own natural laws.”
Ryker: *laughs again* “You think you’re special…”
Xin: “I never said that” “I'm just explaining why that metal is the same strength as mine”
Ryker: “I didn’t get the power to create, mold and summon metal from you, bud.”
Author “doubt” “ Hi Axolotl “
THE Author: “sup.”
Ryker: *listening* “We aren’t talking about you right now. Go away.” *makes a stronger metal to show off* “Anyways, Jeff, do you want a magical wish? Cause I’ll grant you one for a favor. One that you can’t refuse.” *glances back to the north*
Xin: “I'll take you up on that offer.”  
Ryker: “All right. There’s a part of the gem that you had in your arm to the north, if you get that, I’ll grant you a wish.”
Xin: “done” “ The quest and send you a report mentally” “ you have the choice to share it with the others.”
Ryker: *chuckles* “I should have thought of that.” *a brown bar appears on the top right of everyone’s eye that reads: Achievement Got: Video game Achievements unlocked* (update: achievements can now be stated in yellow italic text)
Xin: “got to get them all” * He leaves on his quest *
Ryker: “Fascinating.” 
(See infrastructure above) As Xin continues on his journey through the forest, he encounters a large temple
Xin: “ahh a, temple bound to have a crap ton of … anything that happens to be negative” *goes in anyways *
It's completely dark there.
Xin : *creates a crystal that has light properties and continues.* * half way down the hall a goblin jumps out and a heath bar appears over him saying he has 12 hp. Xin: “ Okay it's DnD Now” * he  hurles a crystal at the goblin who jumpers aside. The crystal opens up and plasma infused wires come out and grab the goblin doing 9 damage*
Goblin: *deals 5 damage out of the 70 health Xin has*
Xin * creates an automaton that is powered by a stable chrystal the Scorpion has 3 main attacks: 1 - power pinchers, 2 - laser tail, 3 - self destruct. It uses self destruct killing it and the goblin.
Xin “ I love that move” *moves on*
Temple: *has a fork in the road to right or left.*
Jeff:*Walks calmly past, playing his harmonica as he enters the left side*
Holy harmonica: *Shows Jeff the safest path through the temple*
Jeff: “Thanks” *easily avoids traps and dead ends* 
Temple: *impressed*
Xin: *tries to traps jeff for no reason*
Xin: “Dang it Ryker”
Xin: “why are you stopping me from bullying jeff”
Ryker: *appears* “Because he’s nowhere near you.”
Xin: “when did that stop me ?”
Logic: “You literally can't do that. It breaks all senses of logic.”
Xin: “so does Ryker”
Logic: “Well, yes but…”
Xin: “in fact all of this breaks you a ton, why are you here anyways”
Logic: “Because that is just a stupid breaking of logic.” *disappears*
Xin: * Blows up Jeff*
Xin: * Reformes Jeff*
Xin:* traps Jeff in a crystal and makes a ring out of it*
Xin: *Hears harmonica from the ring*
Xin: *realizes he's delusional because you can't play a harmonica in a crystal*
Patron god: *Puts Xin in a crystal and makes a ring out of it*
Xin * whacked jeff upside the head with jeffs patron god
Patron god: *realizes he’s delusional because you can’t whack Jeff in a crystal*
Patron god: *Frees Jeff*
Xin: * escapes and eats all of of Jeff's holy big macs*
Jeff: *has no holy big macs*
Author deleted the last few minutes for THE Author.
Ryker: *utterly confused* REDACTED (those moments did not exist) 
“Patron god: “It’s my duty” “I don’t defend him when he can defend himself”
Jeff: “Is that an insult?”
Patron god: “Sort of.”
Jeff: “My uncle and Patron, I gave you the name and duty Dia pátrún an cheoil. It’s a bit of a mouthful. What would you have me call you instead?”
Dia pátrún an cheoil: “You may call me Dia Ceol”
Jeff: “Thank you, my patron, Dia Ceol.”
Jeff and Dia Ceol: *are strengthened, along with their bond*
Jeff’s armor: *blazes with light and gains irish characters, and the chinks in the armor are filled with golden chain mail*
Xin: *looks in confusion* “What the heck just happened, I feel like I missed something” 
Author: “Yes you did thankfully”
Xin: “okay”
Ryker: “Well, you guys continue on your temple adventure, when you’re both at the end, let me know!”
Xin: *takes Ryker’s left hoodie string*
Ryker: *shouts* “Owth mythung” *administers a small shock to make Xin let go*
Dia Ceol: *Sends down a holy tuning fork*
Jeff: *Accepts it gratefully* “Thanks”
Ryker: *uses his mind to teleport both his “hoodie string” and the tuning fork to him. He looks at the tuning fork, makes a salad appear, and starts eating with it* “Mmm, this salad is great!” *points at Jeff with the fork with his mouth full* “Why haven’t you guys got to the end of the temple yet? Hurry up!”
Jeff: “Uh… Can I have my tuning fork back please?” *puts hand out*
Xin `` ye can have my whip… I mean my hoodie string back
Xin * steals  the hoodie string again and starts whipping rikers salad for no apparent reason*
Xin “ and yes I do know that the sting is  your tongue that's why there is a leather hilt on it.
Jeff: *walks up to Ryker and quickly takes his fork*
Xin: * whipping joseph with the tongue because he hasn't done crap since the beginning*
Xin* Lights fire to joseph’s chocolate cow and milk
Ryker: *takes tongue and fork back* “Stop! This is my fork now! Get another fork.” *hoodie vanishes with fork in it.*
Jeff: “Ugh” *Rocks out on harmonica for a minute or two*
Dia Ceol: *Sends down another holy tuning fork*
Ryker: *takes Xins tongue and makes it into a whip, then hands it back to him*
*Suddenly a girl with honey blond hair and neon yellow eyes walks into the room, around her shoulders is a red backpack. She looks around in amazement but her face falls when she sees the group in front of her.* 
Rae: “Aww who are you guys? Whatever, I'll just be on my way. I'm sure there's at least one empty room in this place.“ 
Jeff: *is confused* *starts rocking out on his harmonica again*
Ryker: “OOOOOOOOOOOH! Another new character!” *pulls Rae back over here using his mind, and make her float* “Nice name, Rae, what’s in the backpack? And neat eyes!” *Ryker blinks and his eyes become neon* “Fascinating!” *His eyes become pure black again* “I can change my shape more than that though” *His body disappears, and he becomes a floating head. Then the head becomes bald, and suddenly, you just see a black orb floating* *a voice from the walls rings out* “Isn’t that cool!” *the eye opens up, and you see a small black dot* *higher pitched voice* “I can even go smaller” *The black dot vanishes* *deep voice* “I can be just a voice.” *returns to normal, hovering* “But you’re pretty cool too.” *lets her go*
Rae: * gets up and brushes herself off* “Well that was…. interesting. Who are all of you? Also to answer your question there is just stuff in my backpack.”
Ryker: *yanks backpack off her and starts rooting through the stuff and throwing it all over* “Hmm.”
Rae: “NO DON’T!” 
*something bites onto Rykers hand. A small ball of lime green fur is clinging on to Rykers hand, bitting it with six pairs of razor sharp teeth. Rykers hand begins to swell. *
Rae: * takes her backpack back and puts the monster back inside.*” I’m so sorry about that, he doesn’t really like people.”
Ryker: *simply causes the monster to cease to exist in annoyance, then the swelling on his hand goes down, and he goes back to normal*
Rae: * looks stunned* 
Ryker: “What?”
Rae: “ my monster. Why would you kill him?”
Ryker: “He annoyed me.”
Rae: “ he was my pet.”
Ryker: *annoyed* “I don’t care, he bit me, he deserved to die.”
Rae: * wipes tears from her eyes* “ I guess it’s fine since he wasn’t my only one but, please don’t kill any of my other ones.”
Ryker: *rolls his eyes* “Why, it’s not like they feel pain.”
Rae: * looks stunned* “ of course they feel pain there still living things.”
Ryker: *chuckles* “I’m alive and I don’t feel pain.”
Rae: “ that’s because your an all powerful being. Also if you don’t feel pain why do you care that he bit you?”
Ryker: “Because it’s rude.” *summons another of the same monster species, unhinges his jaw, and consumes it whole*
Rae: * looks horrified but takes a breath* “ I’m sorry. I have a special connection with these monsters so it’s a little traumatizing too see one of them get incinerated.”
Ryker: *creates a small bowl full of mini monsters and starts snacking on them* *with mouth full* “These are actually pretty tasty, want one?” *holds out bowl*
Rae “ umm sure.” * takes tiny monster out of bowl and puts it in her backpack* “ so who are all of you?”
Ryker: *stares at everyone else* “They’re no one, but I’m Ryker, pleasure to make your acquaintance!”
Rae: “ oh hello Ryker. So what are you doing here?”
Ryker: *waves his hand* “Oh nothing important, just enjoying these imbeciles struggle.”
Rae:”oh fun. But why not help them.”
Ryker: “Why should I?”
Rae:” I dunno. It just seems like the right thing to do.”
Ryker: “What really is right? Who says that they aren’t the ones in the wrong? Anyways, why in the world are you here?”
Rae: “ oh I came here because I wanted to be alone while I do work with my monsters. And it had to be isolated to make sure that no one moved my backpack.”
Ryker: “Sure, alright.” *freezes time, opens backpack, weighs it, eats all the monsters inside, then puts something of equal weight in the backpack, goes back to the spot he was in, and unfreezes time* “Can I see some of the other monsters?”
Rae:” sure” * opens backpack and gasps* “ did you..”
Author: “ok this is where I draw the line” * brings back all of Rae’s monsters and puts them back into the backpack* “ there”
Rae: “ um thanks but who are you?”
Author: “ I am one of the many authors who influence this story.”
Rae: “ oh.”
Ryker: “Hey! You can’t just do that!”
THE Author: “Yeah! Really? He was just enjoying himself!”
Author “ I’m here too”
Ryker : “Finally we agree on something.”
Rae: “ but it’s not really fair that you just eat all of my monsters. I mean what did I do to you. To be fair one of my monsters bit you but he already got punished for that.”
Ryker: “They just taste so good!”
Rae: “ but can’t you just spawn your own? Would it kill you  if you don’t eat my PETS?!! Ok I’ll make you a deal. I’ll do you a favor if you don’t eat my monsters.”
Ryker: “What favor could YOU do for me?”
Rae: “ Well there must be a reason you're staying here, besides watching them struggle. So clearly they're doing something for you. And if I could help them I am doing something for you.”
Ryker: “I don’t need them to do anything, I’m just watching them to be entertained, and I need food to go with my movie…”
Rae: “ I could get you something.” * reaches into her backpack and pulls out an extremely adorable baby chicken with fluffy purple feathers.*” this type of monster can multiply so you could have infinity to eat, then you would have a snack to go with you “ movie” 
Ryker: “But I don’t like the feathers, and I’m not a complete monster. Get me something different, like popcorn.” *shoos her away*
Rae: “ oh” * puts chicken back into her backpack and walks out of the room to make popcorn.*
Ryker: “And make it buttered!”
Rae: * from the other room* “ ok”
Ryker: *watching  a movie on his phone, sobs* “It’s been too long.” 
Rae: * returns with a bag of popcorn that is buttered and gives it to Ryker* 
Ryker: *sniffles and shuts off phone, then duplicates the popcorn, and hands one back to Rae* “Here.”
Rae: “ oh thank you. What are you watching?”
Ryker: “Oh nothing, just a funny old reel of mine, from back in A1.”
Rae: “ Oh cool. By the way, why aren’t your friends doing anything? They’ve been like statues since I got here.”
Ryker: “Oh, they must just be in shock.”
Rae: “ hu. So what were they doing before?”
Ryker: “Just kinda being stupid. One tried to steal my tongue.” *eats a handful of popcorn*
Rae: “ why did he want your tongue?”
Ryker: “I’m not quite sure.” *his hoodie reappears on him* “But it should be safe now.”
Rae: “ weird. What about the other one?”
Ryker: “He was messing around with a tuning fork.”
Rae: “ where did he get the tuning fork?”
Ryker: “From some Diet Cola guy.”
Rae: “ You mean like the soda.”
Ryker: “Yeah, it must have some new prize box, I don’t know how he keeps getting these Diet Cola drink prizes. It’s weird.”
Rae: “ aw I want a soda that will give me free stuff.” 
Ryker: “Is a bucket okay?” *Pulls out a bucket with a sticker of a bucket and a sticker that says “Property of Stanley” on it. He then seems to cast some spell on it* “Just think of something, and it’ll appear in the bucket. Within reason of course.”
Rae: * closes her eyes and pictures something.*
*milk duds appear in the bucket.*
Rae: * pours half of the candy in her popcorn and offers the other half to Ryker.*
Ryker: *takes them* “Thanks!”
Rae: “ No problem.”
Ryker: “Watch this.” *Suddenly Ryker grabs hold of Rae’s hand, and they both see a bright flash.* “Now no one can see you or me.” *he lets go* “And now no one can see you, well, except for me. Essentially, you’re a ghost. You can even fly.” *chuckles* 
Rae: “That's incredible!”
Ryker: “Yeah it is! Even all the inanimate objects you touch disappear, if they aren’t in the line of someone else’s vision. You can pass through objects too!” *chuckles* “And I’m not changing you back”
Rae: “ oh. Why not.”
Ryker: “Because I find it funny. And because no one can hear you.” *begins to ignore Rae*
Rae:”….ok?”
Ryker: *begins watching something on his phone*
Rae:* sits on the floor and wittles a piece of wood.*
Ryker: “If you want to look at my phone, just ask.” *chuckles about something on the video*
Rae: “ ok. Can I watch?”
Ryker: “Sure.” *suddenly the image appears right on Rae’s eyes.*
Past Ryker: *is sitting in gerbil ball with people standing around* “I forgot how to walk.”
Unknown Woman: *laughs* “I’ll push you around for a bit then.”
Ryker: *faintly blushes*
*a bright light appears and Ryker is sitting in a movie theater*
Ryker: “Frozen 72 is a great movie. I can’t believe Anna had ice powers.” *he snacks on popcorn* *There's another flash, and we’re in the real world.*
Rae” wow, I’ve never seen this movie before. In my universe they’ve only made frozen 5,”
Ryker: *chuckles* “That was a great one too. If you want to, I could take you to see Frozen 72. We wouldn’t even have to buy a ticket!” 
Rae: “ Yes please.”
Ryker: *makes a door appear on a nearby wall. To the others* “Come along if you want.” *Ryker splits into two and leads Rae into the movie theater, which is completely empty, other than them.* “Hey watch this!” *he waved his hand, and the movie starts playing*
Rae: “ wow” * she sits down.*
Jeff: *comes out of shock* “That was an interesting turn of events”
Rae: * looks at Jeff.* “ hello.”
Ryker: “Took you long enough. Now shhhhh we’re watching the movie, also, Rae, he can’t hear you, remember.”
Rae: “ I know. I just find it funny that I can talk to him and he won’t hear a thing.”
Ryker: “That is pretty funny…” *thinks for  a second* “Have you realized that everyone’s names here begin with J or R? Weird right…oh wait, you don’t know the other peoples names…” *points to Jeff* “That’s Jeff.”
Rae: “ huh that is interesting. Hi Jeff.”
Ryker: *turns to Jeff* “Rae says Die.”
Rae: “ WHAT! I didn’t say that! Wait. Is this the one who was trying to steal your tongue or the one with the magic soda?”
Ryker: “Soda.”
Rae: “oh. Will you ask him if I can have some of his soda.”
Xin : “The pool pope anointed Joseph as the pool king and gave him unlimited power while in a pool.”
Xin: *gives up the ability to give life to inanimate objects for the same power.*
Rae: “ oh hi who are you.”
Ryker: “The ghost says ‘Go die. I will kill you.” *ignores Xin but cancels out all superpowers in pools*
Rae: * rolls her eyes*
Ryker: *eats his popcorn, and enjoys the rest of the movie* “Welp, it looks like the movie is done…Now, if you’d follow me, I won’t erase you all from existence, and you can return on the quest.”
Rae: “ umm I was never doing the quest but I can help out I guess.”* follows Ryker.*
Ryker: *forces the rest out and closes the gateway* “You could join the quest if you want, but there’s not really a need for you, so you could just watch with me instead…”
Rae: “ ok, I’ll just stay here until they finish.”
Ryker: “All right…” *Ryker teleports away*
Wiziker: *appears in a puff of smoke* “Oh, you two.” *looks at Xin and Jeff* “I was sent here to make sure you keep your end of the deal. I was told there was someone else however. Is” *looks at sheet of paper* “Someone named Rae here?”
Rae: “That's  me.”* raises hand.*
Wiziker: *unable to see her* “Rae? Wait…let me check something.” *he pulls glasses out of his hat and puts them on* “Oh! There you are! Hold on, let me get my earpiece!” *he jumps into his hat, and comes out a few seconds later with some sort of earpiece* “So nice to meet you! I’m Wiziker, Rykers second in command. Don’t worry, he does this all the time.” *he grabs some sort of wand and waves it around*
*Theres a bright flash, and Rae is now visible* 
Wiziker: “Now everyone should be able to see you.”
Rae: “ yea, Ryker turned me invisible for some reason.”
Wiziker: “He does that to all sorts of people, even if he likes them.” *pauses* “He even did it to me once. I couldn’t figure out the Counterspell for a while.”
Rae: “ hu, but why does he do it?”
Wiziker: “I don’t know, probably to keep up his threatening appearance.”
Rae:” interesting.”
Wiziker: “Yeah, it’s like he has two different personalities. But that wouldn’t make a lot of sense after… Oh never mind. Anyway, its nice to meet you!”
Rae: “ it’s nice to meet you too, but would you mind explaining to me who you are?” 
Wiziker: “Oh sorry! I must have forgotten to introduce myself. I’m Wiziker, Ryker’s head researcher, and second in command. When you talk to me, you’re pretty much talking to him.”
Rae: “ oh fascinating! Are you like a variant of him?”
Wiziker: “Oh right, of course you wouldn’t know! Ryker is the head of SOUR, the Society of Universal Rykers, so he’s the leader of infinite Rykers from different universes, like mine!”
Rae:” wow, that’s incredible” * looks at Jeff and Xin* “ so are these guys Rykers too?”
Wiziker: *chuckles* “No.” *thinks for a few seconds* “But we still haven’t found A2’s Ryker, so they’re still out there. I’m honestly curious where they’re hiding.”
Rae: “ oh that’s very intriguing.”
Wiziker: *looks at watch then flinches he then frowns and looks more serious* *hurriedly* “Ryker can’t see us for about a minute, whatever you do don’t trust him, and find Axolotl. You have about 20 seconds to ask me a question.”
Rae: “ how do I find the axolotl?”
Wiziker: “Follow the text, read it backward.” *Wiziker dissapears* 
Ryker: *appears* “That was weird, I swear I sent Wiziker here, but he never arrived…” *looks at Rae* “How? Who? What?”
Rae: “ what?”
Ryker: “How did you get out of the ghost plane? Was it Axolotl…or the author?”
Rae: “ What's the axolotl?”
Ryker: “Oh never mind.” *mumbles something* “Give me a second.” *He teleports away, then appears again with Wiziker* “I found him!”
Wiziker: “What’s going on sir?”
Ryker: “Where we’re you?”
Wiziker: “I accidentally got caught in A1.” 
Ryker: *sighs* “Again? How does that keep happening?” 
Wiziker: “I don’t know, my magic works different than yours.”
Ryker: *shrugs* “Okay, at least you’re here now.” *leaves*
Rae: “ so what are we supposed to do now?”
Wiziker: *opens paper* “It appears that you’re supposed to work your way through the temple to find another clue.”
Rae:” oh,” * to Jeff and Xin * “ shall we continue?”
Wiziker: *waits for a few moments then whispers* “Why aren’t they responding. They’re like statues. Watch…” *pushes Xin down to the ground*
Rae:” I’m not entirely sure. They were like this when I came here to. Ryker said they were in shock.”
Wiziker: “Wanna mess with them?”
Rae: “ you bet.” * messes up Jeff’s hair and balances the holy harmonica on his head.*
Wiziker: *Makes Xin stand on his hand and put his foot in Jeff’s mouth then laughs* “You’re pretty funny.” *something in his hat beeps and he pulls it out. It looks like some sort of computer screen with a bunch of hodgepodge wires sticking out* “Fascinating.” *he looks at Rae* “Yeah, I can see it.”
Rae:” what?”
Wiziker: “Oh nothing…” *stuffs device back in his hat.*
Rae: * looks at him suspiciously but decides not to pry.”
Wiziker: *squints at her* “Hmmmm. Maybe….” *pulls something else out of his hat that looks like a pamphlet* “ummm….I’ll ask Ryker first.” *shoves it back in his hat.*
Rae: * contompates what he could mean*
Wiziker: *looks worried* “Umm, there must be a reason.” *paces* “Should I tell her…no I need to tell Ryker.” *sure face* “I’ll call him.” *pulls out phone and dials Ryker.* 
Ryker: *appears* “What.”
Wiziker: *whispers something*
Ryker: *raises eyebrows* “Are you sure?”
Wiziker: *nods* “The scanner said so!”
Ryker: *shocked* “Don’t tell her yet.” *disappears*
Rae: * sighs in frustration.*
Wiziker: “I’m sorry, my lips are sealed…but once you figure it out, let me know. Your name is more important than you think.”
Rae: “ I have one theory. Am I the missing Ryker?”
Wiziker: *raises his eyebrows* “No, but that would have been cool” *mutters something under his breath*
Rae: * continues to think.*
*Rae’s backpack jumps.*
Voice from inside backpack:* in British accident*” Rae, I do believe that you were supposed to bring scone’s down FIVE MINUTES AGO!”
Rae:” oh sorry L.D.”
Voice: “I TOLD YOU NOT TO CALL ME THAT!”
Wiziker: “LD?”
Rae: “Lottie Darcy, she is one of the monsters that lives in my backpack. She’s such a deva.”
Lottie Darcy: “ I heard that!”
Rae: * pulls out a bag of scones covered in chocolate and caramel sauce.* “ would you mind if I gave these to her real quick?”
Wiziker: “Why would I care?” 
Rae:” I don’t know. It’s kinda rude to leave someone mid conversation though.” * opens backpack and climbs inside.*” Feel free to come if you want to.”
Wiziker: “I’m okay, sometimes pocket dimensions make me motion sick.”
Rae: * voice coming from inside backpack*”alright “
*some rustling noises comes from the back pack. Five minutes later Rae reruns*
Rae:* sighs * “ she’s impossible.”
Wiziker: “Let me try.” *jumps into the backpack* “Now Lottie Darcy, I doubt I have had the pleasure of meeting you. I thought I’d introduce myself, I’m Wiziker.”
Jeff: *pulls his foot out of Xin’s mouth, fixes his red curls, and leaves the harmonica on his head* “Sorry, I was meditating. Dia Ceol and I were having a celestial family dinner.”
Rae: “ oh cool, but how do you have dinner with a can of soda?”
Lottie Darcy :*from inside the backpack* “ GOOD SIR! Don’t you know it’s impolite to walk in on some lady eating her SCONES!!”
Wiziker: “If I would have known you were eating scones, I would have never rudely interrupted.”
Lottie Darcy:” I see. Well then I suppose I will have to invite you inside.”
Wiziker: “If you are currently occupied, I can come back later.”
Lottie Darcy:” I am quite FINISHED, thank you!”
Wiziker: “Well then, thank you for inviting me in.” *walks in* “This is quite nice.”
Lottie Darcy: “ why thank you. I have spent many a years making sure Rae puts up proper decorations.”
Wiziker: *nods* “I have the same problem with Ryker. He wants to put up almost nothing. Have entirely bare rooms. Imagine how dull that could be.”
Lottie Darcy: “ My dear I could not. I am grateful to find someone as apt in interior design as myself.”
Wiziker: “I feel the same way! It’s quite a pleasure to meet someone such as yourself.”
Lottie Darcy: “ you flatter me sir.”
Wiziker: “I know this is odd to bring up, however, I actually live somewhere quite terrible myself, I live in a cave.”
Lottie Darcy: “Perhaps you have fairy lights?”
Wiziker: “I wish, however I am quite poor, and have naught but a television set.”
Lottie Darcy:” WHAT! NO FAIRY LIGHTS!! How awful.”
Wiziker: “Indeed it is, however, as I am not paid, I cannot obtain your fairy lights.”
Lottie Darcy: “ well I suppose you can take my 1970 painting of the eiffel tower.”
Wiziker: “That must be worth quite a lot to one like yourself, I would never accept such an amazing gift.”
Lottie Darcy: “ Oh it's my pleasure, it’s the least I can do  for a fellow art lover.”
Wiziker: *examines the art more closely, then frowns* “I’m afraid this is counterfeit my good lady, where did you get this from?”
Lottie Darcy:” the fine demotion of A59, oh it’s such a lovely dimension, there is art absolutely everywhere, and it’s so beautiful as well.”
Wiziker: *checks his watch* “Oh dear! I’m quite late for an appointment, perhaps we may meet another time?”
Lottie Darcy: “ oh yes, that would be lovely. Ta ta. Oh and do tell Rae that she should be a lot more polite like you, and TO BRING THE SCONES ON TIME!!”
Wiziker: *pulls a plate of scones out of his hat* “Consider it a parting gift. Farewell!” *he jumps out of the backpack*
Rae: “ So how did it go?”
Wiziker: “Quite well! Lottie is a quite polite person! It was a pleasure to meet her.”
Rae: “ you should see her when she’s in an extremely bad mood, then she is a nightmare.”
Wiziker: “Well then why not evict her?”
Rae:* looks shocked* “ I couldn’t do that. She may drive me nuts but she’s still my family.”
Wiziker: “Your family?”
Rae: “ I’m an orphan. The monsters in my backpack are the only thing I have that resembles a family.”
Wiziker: “I already knew you were a….never mind.” *purses lips*
Rae:” I’m going to assume that you weren’t supposed to tell me that.”
Wiziker: “Tell you what?”
Rae: “ that you know more about me than I’ve told you.”
Wiziker: *clears throat* “Anyway….”
Rae: * nods* “ So what is this quest?”
Wiziker: “To get to the end of the temple.”
Rae: “ well I figured that much but what’s the point of getting to the end of the temple?”
Wiziker: “There’s some sort of message at the end that will lead somewhere else.”
Rae: “ wait so this is all just a big scavenger hunt?”
Wiziker: “According to this.” *holds up the paper* “Yes.”
Ryker: *appears* “Speaking of which, you all need to get going on that.” *looks at Wiziker* “Why are you still here? You should get back to researching.” *teleports Wiziker away*
Rae:* stands and waits for Jeff or Xin to do something*
Ryker: *annoyed* “You two need to do something other than just stand there.”
Rae:” oh” * sharpens sword*
Ryker: “Not you.” *rolls eyes* “These two doofuses.” *mutters*
Xin: *uses  the elements to make a pool and sits in it gaining infinite power and understanding.
Xin: *Looks and wiziker “nice to meet you kind sir.”
Xin: * looks at ryker “ please no need for impatience as immortals we have no reason to go so quickly but if you insist.
Xin: *creates a pocket dimension where he can pull out infinite pools.
Xin: *teleports them all to the destination of “the north”
Xin: *Retrieves the multiversal gem shard that is there and gives it to ryker.
Xin: “I do believe that you owe me a wish now”
Ryker: “I already disabled all pool powers. That was a fun fever dream.” *laughs* “You can’t have infinite power.” 
Rae: “ What fever dream?”
Ryker: “Xin had a fever dream that he was all powerful because he stepped in a pool.”
???:*walks in* “All powerful like you?”
Rae: “ Who are you?”
Ryker: “OOH, another character! Fascinating. Good job on getting people Author.”
4th wall: “Ow! My back!”
Cancer: “My name is Cancer, and who is 4th wall?””
Ryker: “Oh, I break him all the time.”
4th Wall: “STOP IT!”
Ryker: “Stop being a poor sport. Anyways I’m just shortening your name to Cancer. That all right?”
Cancer:” that’s fine”
Ryker: “So…what can you do? Eat a lot, sense powerful beings, yodel?”
Cancer: “ I posses some very powerful armor and a sword to match, I call them a Shard Plate and Blade.”
Ryker: “Not the shards I’m looking for! Cool though!” *looks at armor* “That is quite well designed. I’ll take that!” *duplicates armor and puts it on himself.*
Rae: “ Hello Cancer.”
Cancer: “im not fond of the duplicating power that you posses.”
Ryker: *chuckles* “What about this?” *He severs his head from his body, lights it on fire, duplicates it into three, then begins juggling on one foot.*
Cancer: “ you seem to be quite the Show Off”
Ryker: *reforms* “Rude.” *teleports behind her* “But I can deal with THAT.”
Rae: “ oh boy,” * steps away from them and creates a force field around herself.*
Cancer: *changes shape to spiky creature and summons armour and blade*
Ryker: “Why didn’t you tell me you could change shape. That’s a cool skill!” *begins cycling through all sorts of creepy and concerning creatures before shifting into Wiziker*
Cancer: “ are you and Wiziker one in the same?”
Ryker: *shifts back to his normal form* “No. Wait…how do you know about Wiziker?”
Cancer:” I’ve been watching for a while”
Ryker: “Did you enjoy the movie?”
Cancer: The frozen movie, or Xin’s fever dream?”
Ryker: “Both.”
Cancer: “I found them both quite confusing and enjoyable”*returns to original form dismissed armor and blade*
Ryker: *turns to Rae* “Wait…how did you create a force field.” *looks in concern*
Rae: “ It's one of my powers. I can create protection around myself and other things. It's how I travel through the multiverse without dying.” 
Ryker: “Okay.” *sighs in relief* “Anyway back to you Cancer, what are you doing here?”
Cancer: “I am looking for multiverse gems to enhance my armor and blade”
Ryker: “Well you’re looking at three shards right now. I’ll help ya! How do you want them enhanced?”
Cancer: “I would like to have my amoure change with my shape and my blade to change shape at my will.”
Ryker: *stares at her for a second* “Okay sure.” *smiles* “Done.”
Jeff: “Wait a second.” *tapps chin* “Does this mean that you are wearing and wielding dead spren?” * narrows eyes* “they should change shape on their own if they were living… like mine.”
Dia Ceol: “He and I gained a Nehel bond once he gave me a name and a purpose.”
Jeff: “In my culture, our ancestors can become spren, if they choose to aid the living.”
Ryker: “All right then. That's a bit funky…”
Jeff: “And does that mean, Cancer, that you are aware what Ryker can do with a gem inside of him?” *Pales* “Spooky stuff”
Ryker: *laughs* “Sure, it’s a bit funky, but I’m proud of it.” *laughs and says* “How are you Diet Cola?”
Dia Ceol: “Oh, I’m having a swell time.”
Ryker: “Good! For fun, I may just revive you. Will you go overboard?”
Dia Ceol: “What do you mean, exactly?”
Ryker: “Try to kill me, take gems, etc.” *thinks* “What can you do if I revive you?”
Xin:  “hey there are children reading this.”
4th Wall: “Ow! My back.”
Ryker: “What’d I say?”
Cancer: “you said that Dia Ceol might try to Kill you”
Ryker: “OOOOh, I’m so scared! Even if I die, I come back so….”
Cancer: “whatever” *rolls eyes* “And yes my spren are alive, I was just seeing how much Ryker Knew of spren kind.”
Joke:”Well well well, I have finally come back”
Ryker: “WE’RE ALL ALIVE!!!! NO ONES AFK!!!”
Boqueque: **Creepily smells your clothes…**
4th Wall: “STOP INJURING ME!!!”
Joke: *Uses new vires to destroy Boqueque*
Jeff: *responds to Cancer* “Ah. Good move.”
Cancer: “why must you smell clothes, and thanks jeff”
Ryker: *snaps Boqueque out of existence*
Dia Ceol: *To Ryker* “I will remain in the Cognitive Realm, but I can Send more complex objects and affect the Physical Realm more directly.”
Ryker: “Right…okay cool.” *revives Dia Ceol* “There ya go!”
Cancer: “In what position is Rae in right now?I presume that she is dead or something.”
Ryker: “I have no idea.”
Cancer: “cool”
Ryker: “Welp, will you guys finally move on with the dungeon?”
Cancer: ”perhaps, perhaps not”
Jeff: “I was disowned ready.”
Xin : “ just like in real life”
Jeff: *shoots an annoyed glance at Xin* just read my bio.
4th Wall: *dies*
Ryker: “NOOOOOOOOOOO! 4th wall!”
Cancer: “a minute of silence for 4th wall”
 Ryker: *plays taps on his nose*
Cancer: *rolls eyes at Ryker*
Jeff: *Plays sad tune on his harmonica*
Cancer: *Changes shard blade into guitar, plays sad music to match Jeff’s”
Rae: * plays sad violin music*
On CD  Xin: *plays a crystal cello
One minute of silence later
Cancer: “kay so how are we going to continue?”
Ryker: “That’s your guys' choice.”
Jeff: “Can we just finish the temple?”
Cancer: “I agree lets just finish the temple, we've been here a long time”
Jeff: “Yeah. I’m honestly surprised nothing has happened to us as we sit here for hours on end.”
Cancer: “Yeah Im surprised too, but lets get moving before something does.”
Ryker: *cues boulder* 
Boulder: *Comes rolling to smash everyone*
Jeff: *Dodges quickly into the next room*
xin: “ okay but can we eat before we begin”
Cancer: *summons Plate and Blade to protect herself*
Boulder: *continues rolling after being sliced in half*
As you enter the next room, you encounter a crossroads. You can go left or right
Rae: “ so which way should we go?” * to Joke* “ also who are you?”
Ryker: *points at Joke* “He’s Joke.” *mumbles* “This has gotten out of hand. These people need to calm down.”
Jeff: “I’m calm.” *raises hand*
The Great Reset
 Ryker: *engages mind wipe on all the characters but himself, Diet Cola, Rae, Jeff, and Cancer in the nearby vicinity and teleports them to the front of the temple* “Welcome! I am Ryker, all powerful creature. Whoever reaches the end of this temple first gets one wish.”
Jeff: *Pulls out tuning fork* “Got it.”
Ryker: “Wait till I say go.” *wait a few moments* “Goat!”
Jeff: *flinches forward a little* “Oops!”
Ryker: “I got you! Ha!” *waits a few more moments* “Are you all ready?”
Jeff: “I was disowned ready.”
Rae: “ Can I just wait here?”
Cancer: *summons armor*
Ryker: *shrugs* “I don’t care.”
Rae:” “ cool.” * sits on the ground and whittles again.*
Ryker: “On your mark….get set….go!”
Cancer: * races inside*
You see a room with two doors one to the left and one to the right
Jeff: *quickly catches up with tuning fork in hand*
Ryker: *waves hand at others* “Didn’t I say go?”
Cancer: *picks left door, continues running with armor summoned and blade at the ready*
You see a room with water flooring
Jeff: *says a quick prayer to Dia Ceol for direction picks the door on the right*
Cancer: *continues on, amour protecting from water*
You see a room with some sort of rust monster
Jeff sees a short pathway
Cancer: “Well this will be a  battle!” *swings sword at rust monster, slicing its leg off debilitating it*
Cancers sword begins to rust, weakening it
Jeff comes to a turn, he can then go left and upstairs, or forward
Cancer: *unsummons and resummons to remove “rust”*
Jeff: *after a quick prayer, goes left* 
Jeff sees some short pathway to a pile of gold
Cancer sees the monster bleeding, unable to attack
Cancer: *deals killing blow, follows jeff*
Cancer takes a long path and is about 20 yards behind Jeff gaining
Jeff: *walks slowly toward the possibly trapped gold*
Jeff encounters no traps currently, with 10 feet to the gold
Jeff: *continues warily towards the gold*
Cancer: *follows shortly behind*
Jeff triggers no traps and is at the gold
Cancer follows shortly behind
There is a small plaque that reads, What is the true treasure? There are multiple different necklaces, and other forms of Jewelry lying around
Cancer: *looks around the jewelry, attempting to find the item of jewelry that has been made with the shard inside*
She finds nothing
Jeff: *quickly gathers the gold for his family*
Cancer: *continues on*
She finds NOTHING
Cancer: *turns around to return to the room with two doors, goes down right instead*
She encounters nothing new the paths seem to have linked up to this room
Cancer: *confused, returns to Rae*
Rae: “ oh your back did you find anything?”* in her hand is a small wooden fox that she whittled, and she is starting on her second creation.*
Cancer: “found nothing, seems to be a dead end.”
Rae: “ oh I’m sorry.”
She didn’t realize, but at this moment, a TV screen began to play in the gold room
Jeff: *startled by the screen, intently watches it*
It says multiple cheesy quotes such as “The real treasure is the friends we made along the way.”
Cancer: *unaware of the tv screen* “maybe I missed something i don't know, maybe i should go back inside, will you come with me rae, i think that jeff may have found something, he hasn't come back yet”
Ryker: *mad* “No she opted out of the race, she can’t go in the temple.”
Rae: “ sorry otherwise I would have loved to go with you.”
Jeff: *follows his path back out of the temple*
Cancer: “that's okay, hey Jeff, find anything?”
Jeff: *Walks up to Cancer* “After you left, a strange moving picture appeared.”
Rae: “ like a TV?”
Jeff: “TV?” *furrows his eyebrows*
Cancer: “ What's a TV?”
Rae: “ It’s a screen with thousands of lightbulbs lighting up with different colors at the same time…”
Jeff: “Light - Bulb?”
Cancer: *confusion evident* “how big are these light-bulbs? They must be very small, or the TV must be very big to work together, how do they even work together?”
Rae: “ they light up, and they're so small you don’t really see the light bulbs themselves, but they make pictures that can move. They're really popular in lots of universes.”
Jeff: *slightly less confused* “huh”
Ryker: *frustrated* “Hurry up with the riddle.”
Jeff: “Oh. Yeah. Sorry”
Cancer: *still slightly confused* “ I think that I get it, what was the riddle again?”
Jeff: “Anyway, the Tee-Vee was writing out sayings like ‘real treasure is the friends we make’ and such”
Cancer:”Hmm. I somehow don’t think that that is relevant to the riddle and what we are trying to do.”
Ryker: *frustrated* “JUST FIND THE STUPID FRIENDSHIP BRACELET ALREADY!”
Cancer: “we need to go back into the room with the gold, and find a friendship bracelet.” *follows Jeff back into the room*
Jeff: “Oh.” *hurries back to the room*
They both find two halves of a friendship necklace
Cancer: *walking toward jeff* “I think that we need to connect these together, but let's not put it on because we don't know what it will do.”
Jeff: “Alright” *Hands his newly acquired friendship bracelet to Cancer*
Cancer: *connects necklace with Jeff’s half, flashes and a whole necklace is lying upon the floor where she drops it*
The ground shakes, then opens up and the gold vanishes. They land in a small lake with  a door on each end
Cancer: “oh boy, a guessing game. Let's summon the almighty riker and find out where we are supposed to go.”
Jeff: *says a quick prayer* “Imma go that way.” *goes to the door farther away*
It's a dead end
Cancer: “Ryker isn't coming, i'll follow you.”
Jeff: *checks other door*
Cancer: *Checks the door opposite*
Both are dead ends
Cancer: *returns to central room* “it must be the last door, or were stuck” *summons shard blade*
Jeff: “I had a feeling this would happen” *readies tuning fork*
Cancer:*goes into the remaining door, sword at the ready*
You see a small plaque that says  “Wrong way”
Cancer: “I think that the plaque is wrong and that we must keep going on into the pathway, otherwise I think that we missed something in one of the other rooms”
Meanwhile at the entrance Ryker flies around to the other entrance
Rae: * walks to the entrance, not because she wants to go in but to see if there’s anything stoping her from going in.*
There isn’t 
Rae: * goes back and wittles again*
Jeff: “I think there’s something sinister in the central room”
Cancer: “I agree.” *returns to central room*
There’s a ladder and a plaque that appears and reads, “try the other side.”
Jeff: “I've tried both sides…”
Cancer:”hmm, i think that their is an invisible door that we aren’t seeing.”*starts running hands along the wall all around the room*
Jeff: “There's an easier way.” *hits the wall with his tuning fork*
Cancer:*confusion* 
The wall: *shakes*
There’s nothing in the walls you idiots
Jeff: *checks the other door again.*
Cancer: *follows*”how's this going to help?”
This is a big dead end, dufuses. They both oddly feel insulted
Cancer: “I don’t think that there's anything here, maybe we should go back up.”*goes up the ladder*
Jeff: *goes up the ladder*
Cancer: “is there anything even in this temple?”
Xin: *just sitting there “ since I was just here, I think I should get serious” *Body begins to convulse metal leaking out into armor and crystal filling the cracks, elements swirl together to  create a sword and shield, and he creates a bow and quiver of alivend arrows.*
Quarith “ Now that that idiot is out of the way, I can begin my work. *begins work on a mysterious crystal.*
Quarith* follows Jeff absent mindedly.
Rae: *to Xin* “ Are you going in?”
Quarith: *eyes flash in anger* “Impudent child. I have work.”
Rae:” rude.”*draws sword*
Quarith *looks at her* “You cannot beat me. I was trained by Death himself.”
Rae: “ Well, I’ve escaped death's grasp before.”
Quarith “ You misunderstand me. Death is the omnipotent ruler of the author's universe. You know him as a Ryker. Though that sentence has no meaning to me, as Death in my universe is both more powerful, and weaker”
Rae:”ok.” *disappears*
Quarith *continues on*
*enchanted chains come out of nowhere and wrap around Quarith, restricting his powers.*
Quarith: *with a shrug vaporizes the chains with his sword, and draws an arrow, shooting Rae's arm. He walks up and treats the wound* “Please don't interfere with me, or you will perish.”
Rae: “ What are you doing anyway.”
Quarith: “ I'm sorry, but the only people in this multiverse at liberty to hear that are members of SOUR.”
Rae: “ So are you a Ryker too.”
Qaurith “No. I do not qualify. Though I am an emissary. The problem is that dufus, Xin, interferes with my work.”
Rae: “ So I'm going to assume that they’re not good plans.”
Qaurith: “ Why would they be nefarious? I live only to serve death and he has a message for Sour. But There are things I need to attend to.”
Rae: “oh. Ya know you could have just said that. I thought you were doing something that would break the universe or something.”
Quarith: “Please excuse me” *teleports to Jeff*
Rae:* turns visible again, puts sword in her belt and starts rummaging through her backpack.*
Jeff: *Slowly backs away from Quareth* “Hey, woah! Why do you keep coming over to me when you say you need to finish your work?” *points to crystals filling armor cracks* “Why are you here, Yelig-Nar.”
Ryker: *floats up* “Hey, if you don’t mind, I’m a bit busy at the moment, so Q, please don’t interfere. After my game is done, then you can talk to me.” *floats away*
Quarith: “Thank you for your generosity, I will participate in this strange game.” *draws his sword and continues up the ladder.* 
Ryker: “No you won’t.” *pauses Quarith* “Anyway, now that he’s paused, you guys can continue.”
Jeff: *is in the former treasure room* *Looks around*
He sees nothing
Jeff: *frowns* 
Joke: *Looks around and sees everyone left him* “Well now I guess I just sit and wait for them.”
Rae: “ I’m here.”
Joke: *Begins listening to one is the loneliest number* “Wait a minute” *Has an idea*
Joke: *Starts chanting a strange incantation and then disappears in a cloud of smoke*
Rae: “ ok then?”
Quarith’s astral projection * follows him* 
Ryker: *annoyed, watches them both*
Cancer: *has just been sitting here the whole time only just now realizes that they should continue on their quest*
Ryker: *annoyed* “Yes, you should.”
Joke: “HAHAHA! You actually tried to follow me, Quarith!” *Then he leaves into the archive*
Ryker: *curious, splits, and teleports to Joke*
Joke: “Hello, Ryker. Welcome to the archives, or at least a part of it.”
Ryker: *destroys the section of the archive* “Ha! That was as fun as when I killed Mimick!”
Joke: *Chuckles as it re forms around us* “Did you think I would actually go to the real archives? This is just an access point. It can reform at any time. I came here because I would like to have a chat.”
THE Author: “Joke, don’t show Ryker the archive, it’ll be difficult to affect him around. Please leave now, or your device will be destroyed.”
Joke: “Yes, author I will lead him away”
THE author: *rewinds time but allows Joke to keep his memory* “Don’t do that again, or Ryker will gain access to the main program, which you do not want.”
Jake: “Ryker, I would like to speak with you.”
Ryker: *appears* “I’m a bit busy, what do you want!”
Rae: * walks into the temple.*” Hi guys. I got bored waiting outside.”
Jeff: *walks out and goes to the back of the temple*
Rae:* follows*
Ryker: “Good luck.”
You enter the back of the temple and see an office door with the number “427” on it
Rae: “ should we go in?”
Jeff: *Enters the door*
Rae: * enters too.*
They arrive in an office room, however, they are not in the same room, the other person vanished. The door closes behind them
???: “This is the story of a man named Stanley.” *comes from unknown source*
Joke: “Ryker I have a birthday present” *Gives him a present*
Ryker: *carefully checks it, then opens it*
Joke: “I hope you like it, It took me all morning to make you your favorite cake.”
Ryker: *makes it work like Soos’s pizza from gravity falls* “Thanks.” *eats a part of a slice of cake, then it regenerates.*
Joke: *leaves and heads to a town called cyrotin*
Joke approaches A a building with tall white pillars that had a sign out front that said Cyrotin local library
Joke: “Finally, this is the only good library in A2” *Jake enters the library and heads over to a section titled the multiverse gems* “Maybe this book will have some information on where they are at.” 
Librarian: “Excuse me sir this section of the library is restricted”
Joke: “May I ask who gave this restriction”
Librarian: “King John Ⅳ”
Joke: “Why did he ban them?”
Librarian: “He feels that no one should get ahead of his quest to find this universe's gem.”
Jake: “Okay I can leave now”
Librarian: *Confused that he was so compliant*
Joke “Little did he know that I was staling so that my machine could copy it” *He leaves the library and goes over to a little cafe and begins to read the copy on a little screen.* “When I am done reading my book I will have to tell ryker about the other king trying to control the gems.”
Waitress: “What can I get you sir?”
Joke: “I would like a strawberry milk please.” 
???: “Stanley worked for a company in a big building where he was Employee #427. Employee #427's job was simple: he sat at his desk in Room 427 and he pushed buttons on a keyboard. Orders came to him through a monitor on his desk telling him what buttons to push, how long to push them, and in what order. This is what Employee #427 did every day of every month of every year, and although others may have considered it soul rending, Stanley relished every moment that the orders came in, as though he had been made exactly for this job. And Stanley was happy. And then one day, something very peculiar happened. Something that would forever change Stanley; Something he would never quite forget. He had been at his desk for nearly an hour when he had realized not one single order had arrived on the monitor for him to follow. No one had shown up to give him instructions, call a meeting, or even say 'hi'. Never in all his years at the company had this happened, this complete isolation. Something was very clearly wrong. Shocked, frozen solid, Stanley found himself unable to move for the longest time. But as he came to his wits and regained his senses, he got up from his desk and stepped out of his office.”
10 minutes later
Joke: *Reads a section on the possible locations of the gem shards on A2* “Yes, I mean sure it is only possible locations but this will still narrow it down”
Ryker: *chuckles over his shoulder and points at different locations and says “Nope” to every one of them. * “This king can’t do much to stop me anyways Joke.” *teleports back to wait for another movement from the temple adventurers*
Rae: * looks around the office*
???: “All of his coworkers were gone. What could it mean? Stanley decided to go to the meeting room; perhaps he had simply missed a memo.”
The office has an appearance of an everyday office, there is an L curve straight ahead which seems to lead to another section of the office, and a window to your left. There are a few doors to your right
Rae: * opens one of the doors.*
The doors are locked
THE Author: *chuckles* “I really enjoyed this game..that was fun.”
Click here to see a map that will make no sense to most of you
Rae: * picks the locks.*
The doors appear to be fused shut. They may just be a part of the wall
Rae:* try’s next door*
???: “No matter how hard Stanley looked, he couldn't find a trace of his co-workers.”
None of these doors work.
Jeff: *Goes down the hall*
Rae: * follows.*
Jake: *Board, decides to make A tablet to watch frozen 75 on* “Why will it not load.” *Recreates a portable hotspot to get wifi* *Starts singing Let it go*
Ryker: “Stop singing.” 
Jake: “FINE” *Starts singing it in his head*
Ryker: “I can still hear you.”
Jeff sees another room that looks quite similar. At the end of it, there’s a hallway that appears to turn left.
Rae: * goes down down hallway.*
She sees the same thing as Jeff
Rae: * heads into room*
Wow cool office room! The second one is slightly larger than the first.
Rae: “ Again?!”* starts exploring.*
???: “Stanley clicked on literally every single door in the office, because he doesn’t pick up well on clues from his environment.”
Rae:*looks for stuff in the office that might be useful.*
There is a bucket sitting on a pedestal that looks exactly like the one Ryker gave to Rae
Rae: “ odd.” * Takes out the bucket.*
???: “Wait…Stanley? How did you get two buckets?”
Rae: “ Im not stanley. Who are you?”
???: *can’t hear her*
Rae: * Sighs and gets a vial of poison out of the bucket.*
???: “Stanley pulls a vial of poison out of the bucket.”” *pauses* “Wait. That isn’t right.” *causes poison to vanish*
Rea: * is confused.*” hey my poison.”
Author: * To THE Author* “ Whatcha playing?”
THE Author: “I was playing the Stanley Parable a couple of minutes ago….”
Author: “ Oh I loved that game as a kid.”
Rae: “ oh I think I know what to do.” * goes looking for the meeting room.*
???: “When Stanley came to a set of 2 open doors, he entered the door on his left.”
Choose left or right
Rae:* chooses door on the left.*
You walk into a meeting room.
???: “Yet there was not a single person here either. Feeling a wave of disbelief, Stanley decided to go up to his boss's office, hoping he might find an answer there.”
Rae: * goes to bosses office.*
???: “Coming to a staircase, Stanley walked upstairs to his boss's office.”
You can walk upstairs or downstairs
Rae: *goes upstairs*
???: “Stepping into his manager's office, Stanley was once again stunned to discover not an indication of any human life.” 
The main office is to your left, with a bathroom behind you.
Rae: * enters office.*
???: “Shocked, unraveled, Stanley wondered in disbelief who orchestrated this, what dark secret was being held from him! What he could not have known was that the keypad behind the boss's desk guarded the terrible truth that his boss had been keeping from him. And so the boss had assigned it an extra secret PIN number. 2845. But of course, Stanley couldn't possibly have known this.”
Rae:*walks over to key pin and enters the numbers 2845.*
???: “Yet incredibly, by simply pushing random buttons on the keypad, Stanley happened to input the correct code by sheer luck. Amazing. He stepped into the newly opened passageway.”
The fireplace opens up and unveils an elevator
Rae: * goes into elevator and presses button.*
???: “Descending deeper into the building, Stanley realized he felt a bit peculiar. It was a stirring of emotion in his chest, as though he felt more free to think for himself, to question the nature of his job. Why did he feel this now, when for years it had never occurred to him? This question would not go unanswered for long.”
The elevator opens at the bottom
???: “Stanley walked straight ahead through the large door that read 'Mind Control Facility'.”
Rae:* walks out and goes through door that has “ Mind Control facility” written above it.*
There’s a button with a lightbulb on it
Rae: * pushes button*
???: “The lights rose on an enormous room packed with television screens. What horrible secret did this place hold, Stanley thought to himself. Did he have the strength to find out?”
A catwalk leads to a camera button
Rae: * walks across catwalk and pushes button.*
???: “This mind control facility... It was too horrible to believe; it couldn't be true. Had Stanley really been in someone's control all this time? Was this the only reason he was happy with his boring job? That his emotions had been manipulated to accept it blindly?”
The walls light up a computer screen, and a catwalk appears that leads to an elevator
Rae: * goes to elevator and goes up*
???: “No! He refused to believe it. He couldn't accept it; his own life in someone else's control? Never! It was unthinkable, wasn't it? Was it even possible? Had he truly spent his entire life utterly blind to the world?”
The elevator leads to a new section of the building
???: “But here was the proof. The heart of the operation. Controls labelled with emotions: 'happy' or 'sad' or 'content'. Walking, eating, working... all of it monitored and commanded from this very place. And as the cold reality of his past began to sink in, Stanley decided that this machinery would never again exert it's terrible power over another human life. For he would dismantle the controls once and for all. And when at last he found the source of the room's power, he knew it was his duty, his obligation, to put an end to this horrible place and to everything it stood for.”
There’s an on/off button with “Mind Control Settings above”
Rae: * simply pushes off.*
???: “Blackness... and a rising chill of uncertainty... was it over?”
A giant door slowly opens
Rae: “ yes freedom!”
???: “Yes! He had won. He had defeated the machine, unshackled himself from someone else's command. Freedom was mere moments away. And, yet, even as the immense door slowly opened, Stanley reflected on how many puzzles still lay unsolved. Where had his co-workers gone? How had he been freed from the machine's grasp? What other mysteries did this strange building hold? But as sunlight streamed into the chamber, he realized none of this mattered to him. For it was not knowledge, or even power, that he had been seeking, but happiness. Perhaps his goal had not been to understand, but to let go. No longer would anyone tell him where to go, what to do, or how to feel. Whatever life he lives, it will be his. And that was all he needed to know. It was, perhaps, the only thing worth knowing. [door completely opens] Stanley stepped through the open door.”
You see the outside of the temple
Rae* runs through the door glad that she didn’t have to wander around the game anymore and goes and sits by Joke and watches Frozen 73*
Rae hears a voice she doesn’t recognize
???: *whispers* “Ask Ryker.”
Rae: “ hello?”
It’s silent again
Rae: “ odd.”
A different voice
THE Author: *to Rae* “Find Smile and Mimick.”
Rae: * ponders what this could mean.*
Ryker: *comes and floats down* “Whatcha thinkin about?” *pauses* “Well I already know who you’re thinking about.” *mumbles something about the author* “I guess I should probably tell you.” *pauses* “I was once part of a being called ‘Rimisile’. Rimisile is a combination of our names.” *purses lips* “I killed them, so that wouldn’t happen again.” *frowns* “I got to know them quite well over the millions of years I was stuck with them.” *furrows his eyebrows and starts thinking out loud* “But why did the author want her to go to the pit?” *worried* “Could he be trying to recombine me?” *pauses* “I should be okay, the gun is destroyed.” *starts pacing* “Right? Even if he did, only certain people, like me, can revive them. And the crater is probably gone too after…” *pauses* “Oh never mind, it doesn’t matter.” *Ryker hurriedly teleports away without his usual flair*
The burnt husk of A1
Ryker: *flies toward a crater, smeltering with eternal flame* “This brings back memories.” *looks down at what seems to be a couple of small burnt pieces of machinery.* “There they are!” *zooms over to what appears to be recently turned dirt* “There you two are!” *he uses his hand to force the two bodies out of the grave* “To ensure the gun is never used again. I’m sorry, old friends.” *frowns as the bodies disintegrate into ash. He bottles the ash, and puts it in his backpack* “That should be good.” *teleports back to A2 next to Rae.* “Anyways, whatcha doing now?”
Rae: * looks stunned.*” well both trying to ponder and process what you mean.”
Ryker: *jiggles the vial of ashs* “Nothing for you to worry about.” *puts ashes away again*
Rae: * ponders more.*” What, might I ask, did you burn?”
Ryker: *pauses* “Some old bridges.”
Rae: * looks at him suspiciously* “ why?”
Ryker: “To ensure my livelihood.”
Rae:*???*” ok?”
Ryker: *pauses time* “All right, that ensures they wouldn’t, but what about others?” *he pulls the vial back out and sprinkles the ash in a pattern around him* “Eerf mi em revo rewop on evah noitcurtsed fo syar eye gniees lla ym rednu yrf dluow emit hsiw I yad rehtona niaga you ees yar rettilps eyb doog.” *pauses* “Sure hope that worked!” *pulls ash back into the bottle* “Now I just have to make sure you are not destroyed.” *splits into two, and has one standing behind Rae, the other in his original position and unfreezes time*
Rae: * blinks. Looks around to see everything is the same.* “ well what are you going to do with the ashes?”
Ryker: “What ashes?”
Rae: *points to the vial of ashes* “ those ones. The ‘ bridges’ you burned.”
Ryker: “Oh, that, it’s um, for protection.”
Rae:” sure”
Ryker: *pulls vial out of pocket, and dumps the ash in his hand.* “Watch this!” *he covers the ash with his other hand, and squeezes hard* “Now watch.” *he uncovers his hand, and there’s a diamond* “Now that, you probably expected, but did you expect this?” *he pulls a ring without a gem out of her ear and places the diamond inside the ring* “Blues a bit much for me.” *he snaps, and the ring’s ruby red* “That’s a ring!” *he slides the ring onto one of his fingers* “There we go!” *the ring vanishes* “It didn’t quite fit with the outfit though.”
Rae: “ fancy. “* tries to read Ryker.*
Ryker: *turns into a book jokingly*
Rae: * picks up book and begins to read it. Notices the Ryker standing behind her.* “oh gosh! You scared me! How long have you been standing there?”
Quarith * Getting tired of being paused temporarily gets the power to escape and is teleported to ryker. “ you know it's rude to leave guests in one space.“ hello you must be rae.” 
Rae: “ oh it’s you again.”
Ryker: *turns back to Quarith* “Okay.” *pauses time for everyone but Quarith* “What do you want?”
Quarith “I'll send you it telepathically” 
Author* coughs* “ gmail … What? “
Quarith * releases the crystal he was working on and gives it to ryker with a quarithinimum ring base, “a gift from my master, he says  you know what it does”
Ryker: *stares at the crystal for a few seconds, and then eats it.* “Great.” *unpauses time* “You can go now.”
Rae: “ What did he do?”
Ryker: “Nothing.”
Rae:” Ok?”
Quarith * begins to convulse and falls on the ground *
Xin * wakes up*
Rae: “ you good?”
Jeff: *geets up off the ground* *groans* *tries to remember where he was*
Jeff saw another room that looked quite similar. At the end of it, there was a hallway that appeared to turn left.
Jeff: “Ah. yes.” *follows the hallway*
Xin “ don't put on that ring ryker then that stick in the mud Quarith will come back.”
THE Author: “This is the GIF police, put your hands up!” *deletes Transformer Reference*
Ryker: *opens his stomach and pulls the ring out of his stomach, then puts it on. The ring vanishes*
Rae:” should I be conserned?”
Ryker: “No.”
Rae: “ too late.”
Ryker: *chuckles* “Hey, welcome back!” *turns around*
Hestuia: “How did you know I was here?” 
Ryker: “I sensed it.”
Hestuia: “I saw the future, so I knew we were going to have this conversation.”
Ryker: “Oh right, introduce yourself to all these people.”
Rae: “ Wait, who is this person?”
Joke: “Hestuia I thought you were banned from this place.”
Rae: “ …what? Hestuia?”
Hestuia: “I’m Hestuia, and I speak for the trees. In fact I can do whatever I please!” *pauses* “And don’t go confusing me with the Lorax.” 
Ryker: “Yeah, yeah Mr. ‘See the Future’”
Hestuia: *shocked* “I…I..finally have more than two lines of dialogue! I’ve been waiting for so long!”
THE Author: “No really. I’m over 900 pages of dialogue, he got about 20 lines in total.”
Hestuia: *stares at Rae for a few seconds* “Well that’s interesting. I would have never guessed.” *squints* “Yeah, I guess I might be able to see it. But really? Her?”
Rae:  “What about me? Is it that thing I’m not allowed to know about?”
Quarith *finishes the transition* he looks at hestuia “the lorax?””who chopped down a tree, How does this happen if the lorax is a fictional character of a completely different multiverse. I have so many questions for you,”
Quarith *slaps hestuia checking for a defensive power but is caught by hestuia who foresaw him doing this.*
Hestuia: “I’M NOT THE LORAX! I am a being that operates like the Lorax, but has completely different sets of skills.”
Rae:” …so your not the Lorax but you go around saying his lines.”
Hestuia: “He copied MY lines.”
Meanwhile: Cancer: *returns to A2, changes form, walks in*
Cancer:”привет смертные”
Meanwhile
Future Ryker: *reads Jake’s mind for the phrase to get to the archive while invisible* Great! Free access *time travels back*
Joke: “I must put phase 2 in to motion”
???: “Are you ready for this?”
Jake: “Yes begin hiding us”
Joke: Хиден Nascondi ହାଇଡେନ୍ | پټ شوی Skjul הסתר
???: ਛੁਪਾਇਆ 秘伝 Dölja
Joke: लुकाइयो Хиден Nascondi پټ شوی چھپایا
???: ndhelik
Joke: مخفي Прихований Verstecken
Joke: “good bye”
???: *Chants incantation and vanishes from the multiverse*
Ryker: “Hmm.” *time travels* a bit later *returns* “Cool, now I can access the archives!” *teleports to Joke* “Whooo boy! This will be FUN! Thanks for the key to the archives.”
Rae:” Joke, what might I ask did you do?”
Quarith: “ joke you showed him the archives !”
Rae:”What are the archives?”
Quarith: “ they are the library of time among other things.”
Rae:” so basically there all of space and time in book form.” 
Quarith: “yes and no”
Rae:” so how bad is it that Ryker now has access to them?”
Both: “ yes.”
Rae: “ oh boy.”
Ryker: “Welp, don’t mind me!” *He teleports to the archive, then creates a link to the computer base to his iphone* “Wait what?” *he looks at his phone and sees someone typing what he’s doing on it. They appear to have his same first name.*
Rae:” so what are we going to do?”
Ryker: *looks up from his phone* “Wait. Rae just talked…and the thing just copied her.” *confused* “What is this?”
Rae:” don’t ask me. I don’t know anything about the archives.”
Everyone hears loud cracking noises, currently never ending
Ryker: “Whoa! This thing predicts the future! That’s honestly pretty cool.” *hands phone to Rae* “Look at this!”
Rae:” I don’t know. Would it be dangerous for me to read them?”
Ryker: “I doubt it, seeing as I had no trouble.”
Rae:” but your all powerful.”
Ryker: *waves hand at her* “You should be fine now.”
Rae:* looks nervously.* “ ok then” * looks at phone and starts reading.* “ whoa. It writes everything anyone every dose.”
Ryker: “I wonder…if I could write my OWN future.” *grabs phone back*
Rae:” here we go.”
Ryker: *typing on his phone begins to glow* “Pineapple!” *pauses* “Whoa! It works!” *types a bit more and he stops glowing*
Rae:*sarcastically*``Oh boy.”
Ryker: *hands phone to Rae* “You try!”
Quarith: “is it the best idea to mess with the time space continuum.”
Ryker: “Yes.”
Rae:”Maybe we shouldn’t.”* tries to hand the phone back.*
Ryker: “You guys are boring.” *takes phone*
Ryker: “Whoa! Something ceased to exist from the document! Did you see that?”
Rae:” ahh….no.”
Quarith: “I did and know I know something that could have been.”
Quarith: *takes the phone and sends himself a link to the archive.
Quarith: *hands the phone back* “thank you”
Quarith * reads the archive then teleports to A1*
Ryker: *concerned, follows him knowing that the splitter ray isn’t in A1*
Rae: “ WAIT. don't leave me here.”
Ryker: *uses mind to put Rae in a gem, and wear it as a ring* “You should be safe in there.”
Rae: * is confused.*
Ryker: “So you don’t get destroyed traveling through the multiverse.”
Rae:``But couldn't I just make a force field?” 
Ryker: *chuckles* “No.”
Rae: “why not?”
Ryker: “Because the waves can travel through most matter.”
Rae:``But I've done it before.”
Ryker: “Well yeah, because….never mind.”
Rae: * is suspicious.*
Rae:* moment sinks in for her. Begins to hyperventilate.*
Quarith: *sees two open graves and looks at rykers hand confirming what he read.
Quarith *quickly types in the archive*
Ryker *looks at his phone to see what he typed.*
Ryker* lookes down to see this.*
The Last will and testament of Quarith. I quarith write this down so all can see. I quarith will initiate protocol omega, a protocol only joke is familiar with. You will all now see the death of quarith Xin and all the others I wish to attempt something even ryker cannot do as such i leave the possessions of this world to my allies for as long as i've been here to rea I leave a gem of unspeakable power. The gem that will grant 2 wishes. To jeff I leave my suit of armour as tribute to you patron god, to joey I have a gift but only after I have died, to Ryker I give you information, what you plan is foolhardy, and to my allie joke I give you the chance to go with me a gift I hope you accept with best wishes- Quarith
Quarith: Teleportes to joke to receive the answer.
Ryker: “I’m actually fine with this.”
Rae:” LET ME OUT!!” * continues to hyperventilate.*
Ryker: *lets her out of the gem, and into a box*
Rae:* screams and tries to escape.*
Ryker: *after going back to A2 with Rae, puts her in a birdhouse*
Rae:* jumps through hole in center.*
Ryker: *puts her in his pocket*
Rae:* climes out and takes a flashlight with a crystal taped to it and uses it to grow herself back to her normal height.*
Ryker: *takes flashlight and shoots it at her again, shrinking her* “Right then” *puts her in his shirt pocket*
Rae:* attempts to get it back.*
Ryker: *eats the crystal*
Rae:* glares at him*” hey, don’t.”* begins digging through her backpack and retrieves another crystal and flashlight wich she uses to re grow herself.*
Ryker: *grabs flashlight and shrinks her again, then grabs her backpack, and empties her pockets, then puts the stuff in a pocket dimension and puts her in his shirt pocket*
Rae:* takes out a flashlight from an emergency location and a tube of glue, then glues flashlight in her hand, jumps out of Rykers pocket and re grows herself.Also glues crystal in flashlight.*
Ryker: *teleports flashlight off hand after disintegrating the glue, then reshrinks her*
Rae:” dang it.”*attempts to get her stuff back.*
Ryker: *chuckles and shoves all of it in a pocket dimension.* “You sure can’t get claustrophobic now that the whole worlds giant.”
Rae:” well try having something way bigger than you pin you down to a point we’re you can barely breathe, with both arms and legs unable to move, and you can’t use any of your powers and see how you like it.”
Ryker: “Nah, I’m good.” *puts her back in his shirt pocket*
Rae:* sighs and sits in his pocket kind board.*
Ryker: *puts a mouse in his pocket too*
Rae:* doesn’t seem to mind and in fact enjoy the new company, and begins to chat with the mouse in its language.*
Ryker: *puts them in a random dollhouse* “There ya go.”
Rae:*says something to the mouse then runs out the front door. Looks for a way to get big again from a book she got from the same emergency source.*
Ryker: *waves his hand to cast a spell so she can’t grow big without him allowing it*
Rae:* glares at him* “ why do you want me to be small so bad?”
Ryker: “To help you learn.”
Rae:” learn what?”
Ryker: “You’ll figure it out.”
Rae:* sighs.*” someone’s going to have to carry me then.”
Ryker: *gives her wings* “That might help.”
Rae:” I’d still rather be carried.”
Ryker: *puts her on his shoulder*
Rae:”thanks.”
Ryker: “Yep.”
Rae hears quiet “Ding.” noises coming from everyone nearby. They endlessly repeat
Rae:* flinches.*
Ryker: *chuckles* “Now you hear them?”
Rae:” what are they?”
Ryker: “You can figure it out.”
Rae:”I’ve got nothing.”
Ryker: “If you listen hard enough, you can hear different frequencies. Try imitating one.”
Rae:*imitates the first sound she hears.*
Ryker: *laughs* “Me? Really? Try something a bit easier.”
Rae:” what?”
Ryker: “Each time corresponds to a person. Try imitating Hestuia over there. The tone is” *hums tone* “Try it!”
Rae:* repeats the sound.*
Ryker: “No no no, you’ve got to feel it.”
Rae:* tries again.*
Ryker: “No, FEEL IT!”
Rae:” I know! I'm trying.”
Ryker: *tries to think* “Picture him in your head. Think all you know about him. Then, from deep down, HUM HIS TONE.”
Rae:” that’s not a lot to work off of but ok.” * pictures the Lorax and Hestuia yelling at her that he is not the Lorax, making him seem more like the Lorax and begins to hum.*
Ryker: “You’ve got it, deeper from your throat.”
Rae:* attempts to do it deeper from her throat.*
She feels something shift, almost…change.
Rae:* feels shocked but continues.*
Ryker: *laughs* “You can stop now.”
Rae:” ok.”
Ryker: “Now try making a forcefield.”
Rae:* makes forcefield.*
Instead of a forcefield, she sees two dark figures flying, fighting, they’re evenly matched. It then stopped.
Rae:” what?”
Ryker: “Ha! Isn’t that cool!”
Rae:” who are they?” 
Ryker: “Who?”
Rae:” the people fighting.”
Ryker: *reads mind* “Hmmm, odd. I don’t know.”
Rae:” hmm.”* thinks for a minute.* “ can I have my backpack back?”
Ryker: “Once you get back to your normal size, sure.”
Rae:” but what’s the point of keeping it from me? I mean I can’t use my sword to fight or anything and my powers aren’t strong enough to take anything down at this size.”
Ryker: “Fine.” *hands backpack back*
Rae:* put on backpack.*
Ryker: *forming something in his hands* “Hmm.” *alters something* “There!” *he hands a small clay ball to Rae, and shrinks it down to her size* “I think you might find this of use. Listen to it.”
Rae:* tries to listen to the ball of clay.*
She hears a tone coming from it
Rae:* tries to copy it.*
Ryker: “Wow! You catch on fast! Now try again!”
Rae:* repeats noise.*
Ryker: “No, you already got the power. Try your ability.”
Rae:* attempts to use the “ power” Ryker was referring to.*
She grows back to her normal size
Rae:” yay.”
Ryker: “There you go!”
Rae:” but I thought I couldn’t grow without your permission.”
Ryker: “I gave it. You just didn’t hear.”
Rae:” oh.”*goes inside backpack. There is shouting from inside the backpack.*
Unknown voice:* from inside backpack with British accent *”WHERE ON EARTH HAVE YOU BEEN?!!”
Rae:*from inside backpack.*” I’m sorry, I had to deal with some stuff.”
???: “LIKE WHAT! Here I am just minding my own business when I find out you have been taking us to a DIFFERENT DIMENSION! Then you nearly squash us all to little pieces with your over reaction and thrashing about business!”
Rae:” im sorry I…”
???: “ and then we unplanly travel through the multiverse AGAIN!! And five minutes later your precious pocket dimension is with LIVING THINGS inside is thrown in to another pocket dimension.”
Rae:” how did you…”
???: “ I assure you I could sense it Rae. I demand an explanation!”
Rae:” I was in a bad situation. Someone took me on a Mini trip through the multiverse, the took my backpack so I couldn’t get to you!”
???” Well this person seems very rude indeed.” 
Rae:” he can probably hear you.”
???:” well good he deserves to know what an insensitive person he is. What kind of a man treats women that way?!”
Rae:” ok just stop. I’m sorry I didn’t have time to check in but you have to calm down.”
???:” well, I assure you I am completely calm.” 
Rae:* sighs* “ I’ll see you later.” * walks out of backpack.* “ Sorry about that. She didn’t mean what she said, she’s just mad at me for leaping dimensions without a warning.”
Quarith: *initiates the protocol after joke said no. h He then teleports all the way to the dimension X3 His home dimension. Suddenly X3 ceases to exist simply gone. xin/Quarith with it seemingly consumed by a 15 year old boy. He is then sent to a2 for some reason. He is teleported to ryker looking at peace with him self.* He takes one look and the ground in front of him begins to shift as if bowing, “Hello he says, my name is lytvkrkdwubclwybfbu;kasybflcaeybxa;weyxlawuafylaiusfbylefiybliuybefqgaweluwetfxkauetfakwne xyefxvkuyetwudgahjgfxajsdfyulbauwefyxblaiusdyfblaeiurfy aiuerfy xaieurfyaler or jim for short.”
Rae:” hello Jim. Why do you look exactly like Xin?”
Jim: “who is xin “ * his face shifted constantly frome every face from that universe
Ryker: “Well Jim, that’s great and all, but I’m worried about what you may become. You have ten seconds to give me a good reason on why you should be alive.”
Rae:* makes a force field around herself.*
Jim: “Quite simply I am a manifestation of Ryker hepworth friend's imagination he is just graciously giving me life by the power of his brain alone so if you destroy me “plot armor” would dictate I will respawn.”
Ryker: “Hmm, okay, I don’t understand half of what you’re saying.” *narrows eyes* “Don’t go overboard.”
Jim:         “I don't plan  to.”
Ryker: “All right…” *turns back to Rae* “Good job with the forcefield, I was older than you when I figured out how to hold multiple powers at once.” *pauses and looks closer* “Looks like you have a limit of 10, hmmph. Odd, even though…”
Jim: *suddenly becomes very violent attacking rea punching the shield with more force than super strength should allow*
Ryker: *glares at him and freezes his muscles besides his mouth* “Don’t try it.”
Jim *dissolves into the finest dust physically possible before being blown away in the wind*
Jim *reforms made of rock *
Ryker: *melts him*
Rae:* reaches into Rykers pocket and retrieves her flashlights which she puts in her backpack.*
Ryker: “Okay lol.”
Jim: become the earth grabbing Rea and dragging her underground.
Jeff: *Falls on his knees in the office*
Dia Ceol: *To Ryker* “Jeff, uh, wants out of the, um, endless office.”
Rae:* uses her mind to break Jim/ the earth apart, levitates up, takes Stanley parable bucket out, makes a potion that blocks all of Jim’s powers and drinks it.*” stop attacking me, Jim!”
Ryker: *teleports Jim to him.*
Jim: *castes the atoms in the stanley bucket apart. 
Jim: *eyes clear* “ oh im so sorry” *Jim heals her completely ignoring the potion that she made.*
Jim: “that was a bit of the megalomaniacs of my universe coming out”
Rae: “It's fine. just don’t do it again.”
Jim: “ I can't make any promises”
Rae* nods a little, terrified.*
Jim: “ I'm sorry for the distress I caused.”
Rae:” it’s alright.”
Ryker: *waves hand, causing Jim to be stuck in this personality*
Jim: “ I feel you tampering with my emotions, please trying to tamper with them will lead to a dimension ending explosion as I can not outwardly release them. And that is something I think we all can live without.
Rae:”We can also live without you attacking me for no reason.”
Jim * slightly annoyed*” As I explained, that was a different me.”
Rae:” different… you?? So you have multiple personalities inside of you?” 
Jim: “No, I have the feelings,  passions and desires of every person in my universe and I have to let them out somehow.”
Rae:” oh, sorry.”
Ryker: *annoyed* “Well , try to control your urges, and behave, or I will destroy you, even with your ‘plot armor’” *makes a realization* “Wait, why has NO ONE found the gem shard yet?”
Rae: “ I dunno. I tried.”
jim: “ I don't know I was just born.
Ryker: “EXCUSES! Find the Gem!”
Jim: “ Why would we do that?”
Ryker: “I’ll give you a wish.”
Jim: “what kind of wish”
Ryker: “Any, as long as it isn’t too crazy.”
Rae: “ Wait, I thought I wasn't allowed to do the quest because I opped out.”
Ryker: “You can opt back in if you want…”
Jim: * shape turns to that of a 4 year old* “ I want a dinosaur ”
Ryker: “Only after you get the shard.”
Jim: “okay”
Rae:”I can give you a dinosaur if that’s what you really want.”
Ryker: *bored, starts playing Pac-Man on his phone* “Meh.” *flings Pac-Man out of the phone to chase Rae and Jim*
Rae:* jumps out of the way of pac man, and makes a shield around herself.* “ No, don't! You know what…”
Rae:* singing.* “ this is the song that never ends. It just goes on and on, my friends. Some people started singing not knowing what it was, and now they continue singing it just because, this is the song that never ends….”* continues to repeat the song over and over and over again.*
Ryker: *continues moving the Pac-Man toward Rae, making it ignore the forcefield*
Rae:* leaps away then begins to levitate and continues to sing the song that never ends louder and more annoying.*
Ryker: *mutes her and makes the Pac-Man fly toward her*
Rae:* stops levitating  and continues to avoid the pac man.*
Pac-Man: *Pac-Man noises intensify, and he begins to speed up*
Rae:* grabs pen out of pocket which she throws at Ryker knocking the phone out of his hand causing the pac man to only go in a straight line.*
Ryker: *not controlling the Pac-Man, picks up his phone*
Rae:* while running grabs a pac man ghost out of her backpack and has it chase the pac man.*
Pac-Man: *eats ghost after eating big dot, then continues chasing Rae*
Rae:* tries turning invisible.*
Pac-Man: *still chasing Rae*
Rae:* runs behind the pac man and stabs it.*
Pac-Man: *dies and respawns*
Rae:* begins chucking pens at Ryker.*
Ryker: *eats pens*
Rae:* gives a confused, and annoyed look.*
Jim: *destroys pacman by casting appart the atoms in its body and destroying the extra lives.*
Rae:* gives Jim a thankful look.*
Ryker: “But I was about to win!!!”
Rae:* sticks tongue out at Ryker.*
Jeff: *Looks around* *whispers* “Dang it!” *Begins praying again*
Dia Ceol: *To Ryker* “Hey, uh, Jeff is still stuck in the office building…”
Ryker: “I thought I got him out…” *teleports him out*
Rae: * waves to Jeff.*
Ryker: *mumbles something about Pac-Man*
Rae: *glares at him.*
Jeff: “Morning!” *sighs*
Ryker: *realizes, yet again, no one is busy doing the quest* “Go back and solve the puzzle temple!” *pauses* “Now!”
Jeff: *regretfully* “Back to… the office?”
Ryker: “Yes.”
Rae:* mouths.*” never!”
Ryker: *teleports them both back into the Stanley parable*
Rae:* teleports back out.*
Ryker: *shuts off Rae’s powers and teleports her back in*
Rae:* mouths ” you suck.”*
Ryker: *eating a ring pop* “Well yes.”
Rae:* repeats the Stanley parable ending she did before.* 
It teleports her back to the beginning
Rae:* redoes the same ending a third time then grabs a note book and writes “ will you unmute me now?” On it and crumples it and throws it at Ryker.*
Ryker: *unmute her and teleports her to the beginning*
Rae:” yes. I got what I wanted.” * sits on the floor then takes out a device wich she hooks on to her chest, pushes a few buttons then disappears and reappears outside of the temple.*”now i can no longer be stuck in a video game and it’s attached to my heart so if you take it of you’ll kill me!”
Ryker: *detaches it, and makes it so she doesn’t need a heart to live*
Rae:* run off.*
Ryker: *teleports her into the office*
Rae:” dang it.” * grabbes out a computer and starts hacking into the game. Makes a pathway to the gem, and grabbes the shard.* “ ok I have your stupid gem now let me out of here.”
Ryker: “Umm….no?” 
FEVER DREAMS ARE AMAZING!
Rae:” oh. Welp, I give up.”
Jim: *starts clicking a button*
Rae:* starts walking around the office looking for the gem shard.*
Narrator: “When Stanley came to a set of 2 open doors, he entered the door on his left.”
Rae: “No.”* enters the door on the right.”
Jim: *gives narrator a body so he can see him
JIM: * BEATS THE NARRATOR INTO SUBMISSION.

Rae:* stares in confusion from her fever dream.* “ Why am I here? I thought I’d never come back to this place.”* stares at a beautiful looking river. Odd creatures are living around the water. Rae’s hair is red.*
Ryker: *appears in the dream* “Neat.”
 Joke: “Finally back to the dreamscape Ryker you should travel into my dream”
 Ryker: *makes mini clone to make a mini copy of his consciousness in* “Now go sacrifice, I’m curious.”
Mini Ryker: *goes in Jokes dream*
Jokeoke: “welcome to the dreamscape”*Mini Ryker is immediately trapped in to a cage* “Now you get to sense the chaos”
Mini Ryker: *turns into mini Pacman*
Jake: “Now you shall fall forever into chaos” *Casts him into the void*
Mini Ryker: *teleports out*
Jake: “Nice just the beginning *mini ryker immediately is distorted*
Mini Ryker: *is alive*
Jake: *Takes away all of his powers and then destroys him*
Mini Ryker: *eating a quesadilla*
Rae:*looks around the sensory and seems to be parlized by the thought of what occurred here. Suddenly black cracks form across her skin and she seems to be in pain. Then blood pours down her shoulders dripping into the river as it goes her hair turns back to blond, it seems to be shorter than normal.*
Ryker: “What  … Just  … Happened.”
Rae:* breathes Heavily.* “ trust no one… trust no one… trust no one.”
Ryker: “Remember! Reality's an illusion, the universe is a hologram, buy gold! Byeeee.” *leaves fever dream*

Ryker: “What? I just heard rain.”
Rae:* rolled eyes.*” I’m not going to argue about this.”*walks away.*
Ryker: “Okay.”
Lottie Darcy: * mutters something about nobody having good manners then runs after Rae.* “ Rae darling do wait for me!”
Ryker: *starts releasing slight pain from the projected cracks*
Rae:* screams.*” RYKER, STOP IT!”
Ryker: “Stop what?” *slowly continues increasing pain*
Rae:* continues screaming.*” the PAIN! Please make it go away!”
Meanwhile, In Rykers head
Good Ryker: “Maybe we should stop.” 
All other Rykers: “No.”
???: “Increase it.”
Evil Ryker: “And you are?”
???: “A..friend. Yes, a friend”
Lazy Ryker: “how about we just chill”
Hyper Ryker: *jumps around* “Or we could just bug her more!”
All Rykers: “Sure.”
Meanwhile
Ryker: *increases pain more*
Rae:* screams again*” just make it stop, make it stop.”
Ryker: *giggles and intensifies the pain even more*
Rae:* eyes seem to turn pure black. She collapses unconscious*
Ryker: *intensifies pain, and changes her hair back to blonde*
Rae:* tears fall from her eyes but she doesn’t wake up*
Ryker: *releases pain* “That was FUN.”
Rae: * stays unconscious for a little longer then gets up and checks her skin and hair, then relieved walks off and seems to be looking for something*
Ryker: *begins scarring her flesh on her back, to look like the black cracks, numbing the pain*
Rae:* winces at the pain and continues looking more desperate now*
Jim: * *looks at ryker rage building up in his eyes. His body begins to crumble as his consciousness suddenly flies into Rykers head and he begins to talk to the rykers* “ that was a very cruel thing to do, stop”
Ryker: “I can’t..STOP.” *he begins to giggle uncontrollably and forces Jim out of his head*
Jim: “ That feeling, that presence I've felt before, wait.” * teleports away*
Ryker: *face shifts* “What..just..happened? There was something…” 
Rae:* seems to find what she's looking for. She takes out a dream catcher and considers something*
Ryker: *shrugs and starts playing on his phone*
Rae: “Maybe I won't destroy them, just take them away for a while.”* seems to power it on almost then puts it to her head and the dreamcatcher glows, she tosses it behind a tree and then looks confused*
Ryker: *goes and gets dreamcatcher* “I think you dropped this.” *hands dreamcatcher to her*
Rae: “ I did?” *Looks at it then tosses it away again*
Ryker: *snaps the dreamcatcher in half* “That was weird, oh well.”
Rae: “ Why did you do that? Now I have to make another!” 
Ryker: *confused* “Why?”
Rae: “ it's my way to forget.”
Ryker: “Why do you want to forget?”
Rae: “ It's not a pleasant memory.”
Ryker: *sighs* “I’ve been there, but it’s better to keep them, rather than forget them.”
Rae: “ I'm not getting rid of them, I'm making sure that they can’t torchure me anymore.”
Ryker: “It’s better to remember.”
Rae: “No.”
Ryker: *shrugs* “I tried.”
Rae: *begins gathering supplies*
Ryker: “Finally, it’s my turn in control!” *starts taking nap”
Rae:* makes a new dreamcatcher and removes memory, then hides dreamcatcher*
Ryker: *grabs dreamcatcher and snaps it in half*
Rae: “stop it!”
Ryker: “No.”
Rae; “ I can’t live with this anymore!”
Ryker: *starts chuckling* “You! You can’t live with it? I see everyone who I kills’ memories, I see everyone’s thoughts, I am all powerful, I experience emotions you can’t comprehend. And you. You can’t live with ONE. MEASLY. THOUGHT.”
Jim: * comes in and teleports into Rykers brain. He begins to chant in a strange language* “ਤੁਹਾਨੂੰ ਨਰਕ ਦੀ ਛੁੱਟੀ ਛੱਡੋ ਅਤੇ ਕਦੇ ਵੀ ਇਸ ਮਨ ਵਿੱਚ ਵਾਪਸ ਨਾ ਆਓ, ਤੁਹਾਨੂੰ ਦੇਸ਼ ਵਿੱਚੋਂ ਕੱਢ ਦਿੱਤਾ ਗਿਆ ਹੈ ਕਿਉਂਕਿ ਮੈਂ ਤੁਹਾਡੇ ਹੋਰ ਦੋਸਤਾਂ ਦੇ ਨਾਲ ਮਨ ਦੀ ਸਕੈਪ ਵਿੱਚ ਤੁਹਾਡਾ ਸੁਆਗਤ ਕਰਦਾ ਹਾਂ ਮੈਂ ਤੁਹਾਡੇ ਕੰਸੀਨੇਸ ਨੂੰ ਪ੍ਰਾਪਤ ਕਰਦਾ ਹਾਂ ਜਿਵੇਂ ਕਿ ਮੇਰੇ ਕੋਲ ਅਣਗਿਣਤ ਹੋਰ ਹਨ, ਨਰਕ ਵਿੱਚ  ਸਵਾਗਤ ਹੈ” 
Ryker: *forces him out*
Jim: “Ryker, why are you letting this man control you?”
Ryker: “NO ONE IS CONTROLLING ME!”
Jeff: *glad his dream was hijacked by Dia Ceol* *Hides*
Ryker: *ignoring Jim* “Sup Jeff?”
Rae:* slips away. Then exits her backpack and starts on another dream catcher* 
Jim:* manipulates the nearby atoms to finish the dream catcher*
Rae: “ Thanks, do you think this is a good idea?”
Ryker: *grabs dreamcatcher and snaps it in half*
Rae: “ hey! Why do you keep doing that?”
Ryker: “Because I know better than you.”
Jim: *teleports to site 19 and starts slaughtering scps.
Rae:*sarcastically* “ Sure you do.”
Jim “ I'm a sentient universe who is going to stop me.”* absentmindedly snapes the mask in half*
Ryker: “I hate SCPP…”
THE Author: “Me too!”
Ryker: “Huh, something we have in common.”
Jim: “will you help me kill them then”
Rae: “ Who are you planning on killing? And what is a SCPP?”
Jim: “ dont act stupid.” * vaporizes the statue.
Rae: “I'm not. I've just never heard of a SCPP.”
JIm: *snaps the shy guy's neck.” just kill the monsters and look it up. At https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/” 
Jim: *has an Idea. “ Hey, do you want to play a cool game I just thought of?”
Rae:” alright.”
Jim: *creates a tiny version of the coliseum out of titanium and grabs a nearby weed giving it life, The weed monster sits in the arena waiting for a foe. “ Now you choses one of your monsters or have me create one for you.”
Rae: “ Will my monsters die if they lose?”
Jim: “ no I will create an exact copy of them for the fight so your monsters wont get a scratch. It's really just a simulation.
Rae:” oh could you do a dragon?”
Jim: “yes but it would have to be size regulation 5 inches equil to my weed monster”
Rae: “ Could you make one.”
Ryker: *puts a miniature version of himself in the arena* The return of MINI RYKER
Mini Ryker: “I’ll be the announcer..” *summons micro microphone*
Rae: “ alright.” *starts digging through her backpack for one of her mini monsters. Brings out a monster entirely made of fire and puts it in the arena*
Jim: *creates a copy of it so it can fight.
Jim: You can pick 2 enchantments for it as it is a magical creacher, Mine gets 3 as it is an alivend piece of plant.  
Min Ryker: *enchanta himself with 24*
Jim: “I can't argue but I can give you a co worker” * creates a tiny Jim.”
Mini jim: summons a mini microphone “ it's going to be a fascinating battle as we wait for the enchantments to be chosen. We have a weed versus pure fire.”
Mini Ryker: *shoves Mini Jim out of the way* “And I’M NARRATING IT!”
Fire monster:* chooses torch and fire ball*
Ryker: *looks at mini Ryker and duplicates him*
Mini Ryker: *whispers something to Ryker*
Ryker: *quickly snaps both mini Rykers out of existence* “Phew, that was close!”
Rae: “ What was the purpose of that?”
Ryker: “To keep a secret a secret.”
Rae: “ Here we go again.”
Rae:* to mini Jim* “👎︎♓︎♎︎ ⍓︎□︎◆︎ ♑︎♏︎⧫︎ ♋︎■︎⍓︎ □︎♐︎ ⧫︎♒︎♋︎⧫︎✍︎”
Ryker: *makes random hand signals to himself* “Got it.” *Ryker glances at Rae again* “I should probably tell you..” *pauses and bites lips* “You’re kinda my daughter, from another universe.” *smiles and says* “So, how are ya doing?”
Rae: *blinks in surprise* “How is that possible? My parents both died when I was five.”
Jim: “Oh no, anyways”
Rae:* shakes her head feeling like everything is more confusing and less confusing at the same time*
Jim: “ nothing really has any logic to it at all since I was born.”
Rae: “ yea it never really made since before you came either.”
Jim: “I feel like the lore is so convoluted we should just try to make out what we can.”
Rae: “ Yeah, that's all we can.”
Ryker: *clears throat* “Um..yes, they did, I Um..killed them.”
Jim: “why would you do that?”
Ryker: *pauses* “So they wouldn’t kill me.”
Rae: “ why would they do that? Why would you do that.”
Ryker: *clears throat* “Because, they’d think I was..evil.”
Jim: “you can be”
Rae: “ evil? Well there must have been a reason why.”
Ryker: *purses lips* “See. This is why I didn’t tell you.”
Rae: “ because I would think you were evil?” 
Jim: “ isn't it evil to kill a five year olds parents.”
Ryker: “Yes. I realize that now. And I’m sorry.”
Jim: “ Then go back in time and fix it.”
Ryker: “That would make it worse.”
Rae: “ Well that was… interesting, so what are we going to do now?”
THE Author: “This is the Picture Police ! Put your hands up!”
Ryker: “Well, I don’t know, maybe you want to do something to make up for lost multiversal time?”
Rae: “ Well I don’t know. Does this mean you're my dad now?”
Ryker: “If you want me to be, I guess.”
Rae: “ I don’t care. It's fine with me I guess.”
Ryker: *clears throat* “Okay then?”
Rae: “ shall we continue with the arena then?” 
Ryker: *awkwardly floats away*
Wiziker: *appears and turns to Rae* “So what shoe size are you?”
Rae: “ why?”
Wiziker: *measures foot* “Okay, and your favorite color?”
Rae: “ uuhhh green I guess?”
Wiziker: *hands a small book to Rae* “Just write some info about the rest of the room in here, and then it’ll be linked to SOUR.”
Rae: “ alright.”
Wiziker: *pauses* “I’m sorry, is there anything else you need?”
Jim: “ Oh I want eggnog.”
Wiziker: *ignores him*
Jim: “ back to the battle.”

Squeaker: *Replies* “Squeak”
Ryker: *starts eating random squeaky toys*
Squeaker: *Squeaks sadly*
Ryker: *Adds some gravy, and continues eating them* “Yum.’ *glares at Squeaker*

Mini Grimlock: “uhhh” *Transforms*
Jim: *looks at Squeaker* “Stop this madness or the council of the star sword will be forced to stop you.”
Ryker: “Coss? That’s not a cool acronym.” *turns to Squeaker* “Wait…did you just eat a blast, and grow?”
Jim: “ yes?”

Cancer:*mind messages rae”fix this please”*
Ryker: *intercepts mind message* “Not food? Then what do you want?”
Rae:* doesn't understand* “ I dunno, did you hurt it?”
Ryker: “I didn’t think so, I just summoned it from another universe. Anyways, what do you want to name it?”
Cancer:*Anger yowls and gives pleading eyes to rae, her understanding of creatures makes her sad and think that something is wrong*
Rae: * picks up cat gently and strokes it thinking of what could be wrong* “ What's the matter Kitty?”
Cancer:*gives pleading eyes and gives mind messages telling rae that the cat is cancer*

Rae:” what did he do?”
Cancer:*claws in mud and arrow pointing at ryker*
Ryker: *still mimicking* “He sent me through some sort of portal, and I ended up here!”
Cancer:* liar in mud, summons blade through ryker staring at him*
Ryker: *prevents these*
Rae: “ Well you're safe now, it’s going to be ok.”
JIm: **pickles up the cat and begins to snuggle it*“ She's cute.”
Cancer: *claws jims throat, runs to rae with sad, pleading eyes*

Rae: “ Yeah I think it is.”
Ryker: *prevents it* “So now what?”
Cancer:* spells in bloody mud, then i would be able to change, but i can't because this dum dum made it so i can't*

Rae: “ odd.”
Cancer: *smears with paw to erase and runs away to find joke or somebody to fix her*

Cancer:*nods*
Ryker: *heard them* “How did you know?”
Cancer: *tries to claw ryker, hisses*
Rae: “ this cat is acting far too suspicious to actually be a cat.”
Cancer: *nods very gratefully and gives slight purr to rae*
Rae: “ So where did you really get this cat?”

Rae: “ That might not be the best idea.” 
Cancer:”ok”
Ryker: *clears throat* “Um, hit me with your best shot?”
Rae: “ That's why I said it wasn’t the best idea.”
Ryker: “No, go ahead! I know you want to.”
Rae:* hits him with her backpack again just because* 
Ryker: “Nice backpack! Where’d you get it from?”
Rae: * considers telling him* “ I actually don’t really know. I woke up inside it after my parents died.” 
Ryker: “Huh, it just kinda looks like..oh never mind, you wouldn’t know him.”
Rae: “ who?” 
Ryker: “Oh, just Mimick.”
Rae: “ hhmmmm.” 
Ryker: “I know I probably shouldn’t bring this up.. but when you were infected with the black crack thing, and how’d you get it?”
Rae:* bites lip not wanting to talk about it* “ It was poison and a “ friend.”
Ryker: “What was This ‘Friends’ Name?”
Rae:” she was a bounty hunter and her name was liv.”
Ryker: “How well did you know her, and why’d you drink it?”
Rae: “ she was my best friend, trainer, and the person taking care of me and I didn’t know it was poisoned when I drank it.”
Ryker: “Why’d Liv betray you?”
Rae: “ well like I said she was a bounty hunter, and at this point I had quite a reward on me, so she wanted to turn me in, so she pretended to be my friend so I would trust her then when I didn’t go to the “ orphanage” she had prepared for me, she poisoned me, so she could turn me in dead.”
Ryker: “Why didn’t you go to the ‘orphanage’?”
Rae: “ well someone would have recognized me and then I would have gotten turned in.”
Ryker: “Did you ever see her again after she poisoned you?”
Rae: “ no.”
Ryker: “Are you sure it was her who poisoned you?”
Rae: “ definitely, she was there when I drank it, she TOLD me she did!”
Ryker: “Huh. Okay. Did it feel better to talk about it?”
Rae:” sorta, why?”
Ryker: “Because I did the same thing with a pineapple.” *pauses* “Do you know what poison it was?”
Rae: “ no, she just said she had spent years perfecting it.” 
Ryker: *squints and thinks* “I don’t know why, but that’s not the first time I’ve heard of what happened to you. I don’t remember when I heard it last, it must have been millennia, because I don’t know what it could have been..”
Rae:” hmmm.”
Ryker: “Why can’t I remember..I remember everything!” *stresses out*
Rae: “ hmm odd.”
Cancer:*crawls out of backpack*”interesting, I’ve had a few encounters with poison but none like this.” *changes back to human form*
Ryker: *exclaims* “That’s it! I had it! Near the beginning..well Mim..wait..” *looks at Rae* “But no..that would mean..” *shock*
Rae: “ what?”
Cancer:”plot twist, Rae is just another Ryker”
Rae: “ hey I had that theory too!”
Ryker: *laughs* “Nope! Close though!”
Cancer: “your previous shock would suggest otherwise but I guess not, though you could just be another one of Ryker’s disciples or something.”
Ryker: “I wouldn’t necessarily classify Mimi..” *cuts off sharply*
Cancer:”did you have a friend named Mimi and Rae is an alternate version of her?”
Ryker: “Closer, but not quite, I don’t know someone name Mimi, just Mi..oh wait, I get it, you're trying to get me to tell you!”
Cancer:” I already know that you have an alternative version of yourself named Mimick, yes¿”
Ryker: “Mimick isn’t an alternate version of me.” *laughs*
Cancer:”then what is mimick as you’ve mentioned him before” 
Ryker: “Dead.”
Cancer:”I’m going to assume that he was a friend and a member of SOUR was he not?”
Rae: “ wait is Mimi that girl?” 
Ryker: “No. there isn’t anyone I know named Mimi, and Cancer, Mimick died before SOUR, and he was more of a rival if anything.”
Cancer: I don’t think that he died, I think he became a part of you, and is corrupting you. “
Ryker: *chuckles* “Oh now that’s rich, Mimick corrupting me! No, Mimick was protecting you from me. But he died. I killed him.”
Cancer: “then he died a long time ago, protecting the universes from your power abusing self  yes”
Ryker: “More like 10 years ago, but yeah. So did Smile!”
Cancer:”mimick tried to kill you using the same poison as was given to Rae to try and kill you, and I think that liv and mimick were working together to rid the universes of a power abusing deity being, and his daughter who would likely inherit his powers “
Ryker: *laughs* “No, wrong again, Mimick is the poison.”
Cancer:”in a way I am not wrong, as liv used mimick to try to kill your daughter, as someone tried to kill you”
Ryker: *scoffs* “Liv was innocent!”
Rae:* bitterly*” no she wasn’t.”
Cancer:”is Mimick just this black self disguising goo that runs around trying to destroy ryker and anything that may resemble a ryker?”
Ryker: “Nope.”
Cancer:”Then what is he, also Rae’s fallen asleep.” 
Rae: “ no I haven’t.” 
Ryker: “He’s human.”
Cancer:” then how can he be a poison”
Ryker: “He’s dead.”
Cancer:”I know that, then how could he have been a poison”
Ryker: “He’s not really a poison, more so just painful.”
Cancer: “So then he changed from human into a mental being and just went around causing pain to everyone who was anything like ryker or had anything to do with ryker?”
Ryker: “Nope.”
Cancer: “humph”*changes to small lizard and climbs into Rae’s backpack and falls asleep *
Ryker: “Rimisile.” *pauses* “Was that only 10 years ago?” *frowns* “I was trapped FOR Millennia, and after 10 years of freedom I get this much power. Wow.”
Jim: “ Okay so now you guys know that.”
Ryker: “Know what?”
Jim: “ all the crap that just happened.”
Ryker: “Do you know the true answer.”
Rae: “No.”
Ryker: “Mimicks inside of you.”
Rae: “ WHAT?!”
Ryker: “I would recommend eating a good amount of energy..or..”
Rae: “ why?! What?! How?!”
Ryker: “Mimick will take more control the less energy you have.”
Rae: * ….* 
Ryker: “or that’s how it worked for me.” *pauses* “I’ve never heard it being done without the splitter ray though.”
Rae: “ what? Also please tell me that there’s a way to get him out.”
Ryker: “The splitter ray got him out of me.”
Rae: “So where's this splinter ray?”
Ryker: “I have it.”
Rae: “where?”
Ryker: “SOUR HQ.”
Rae: “May I use it?”
Ryker: “No.”
Rae: “ why not?”
Jim: “I'm pretty sure that he wants it destroyed.”
Rae: “seriously?!”
Ryker: “Exactly.”
Rae: “Can I use it first?”
Ryker: “No. I can’t figure out a way to destroy it anyhow.”
Rae: “oh.”
Ryker: “Plus, I doubt it would work, seeing on how Mimicks body was burnt.”
Rae: * is disappointed and freaking out at the same time*
Ryker: *shows his skin with slightly gray cracks across it* “This is about what I looked like.”
Rae: “ how did you get infected?”
Ryker: “Same as you pretty much.”
Rae: “ oh.”
Ryker: “Well, not really.” *pauses* “It’s kinda hard to explain.”
Jim: “I'll do it, rykers started out as a being unable to use his power, he was then shot by a universal artifact called the splitter ray, how he got in the situation where he got hit is beyond me, anyway that split him into ryker, mimic, smile and others maybe anyway mimic could copy one power at a time smile controlled a large civilization and ryker could steal other people powers. Smile and mimic disappear for a while. Ryker one day encounters a person with the ability to travel the multiverse. So naturally he slaughters him and steals his powers. Later he finds someone who can stop time so he slaughters him as well. Ryker then went out with time paused and collected all the powers from everyone in the multiverse. That turns him into the being that he is now. Any way he finds and kills mimic and smile. Them all the crap we just discussed happened. Now my guess is either the splitter ray is failing or some found a way to kind of reverse it. 
Ryker: *shrugs* “Sort of.” *pauses* “It all started at the beginning of time. I was a nervous wreck then, and had only collected a couple of powers. However, in my cockiness, I decided to take control of a city called Mehtropolis. When I got quite close to doing so, beating their hero’s of Mimick and Smile, one of the mehs, who I know just as Meh, shot me with the splitter ray, and combined me, smile, and Mimick into one being called Rimisile. About a millennia or two later, one of Mehs ancestors finds the gun,  and shoots it at me again, this time splitting me back into Smile Mimick, and myself. I kinda corrupted both of them during that time, and so, over the course of a year or, I killed them.” *pauses* “How’s that? Make more sense?” *pauses again* “And Jim, you’re right, the splitter ray isn’t working for some odd reason, I don’t know why..I haven’t ever gotten it to work though.”
Rae: “ Wait, if he’s dead, why is it inside of me?”
Jim: “ hes not completely dead per say that would have disastrous coniscouncices on ryker, he transferred into a disease just his physical body dead ryker never figured out what happened to smile, Not you ryker” 
Ryker: “Um..he’s dead. Definitely. Smile didn’t give me the same reaction as Mimick though.”
Rae: “ Wait, how do you know all of this?”
Ryker: “I was theree…?”
Rae: “ no i mean how did JIM know everything?”
Ryker: “I guess he guessed?”
Jim: “ Well I'm a sentient universe and I know a crap ton obout ryker. Take a gander.”
Rae: “oh”
Jim: “ no I'm not oh.”
Ryker: “I am..” *turns into the letter O*
Jeff: *Is in the ‘endless office’, going exactly against everything the narrator says* 
Jim: “ Hey, where is Jeff?”
Dia Ceol: “In the office…. He's the only one still working towards the Shard.”
Jim: “ eporiyavbpero8tuvbaoieeubaclwehrlicusbyeartloearltiovbya;oweunoiadutna;oieutbvaioerubtaoeiurt;abiirtubaiubt;iaeiutbvaeibhvlkuaeyc;akwejtjvliuefkyuaeykiaehrgruaieykauueytvliuuaerytbvlauerybvluieartyvlaierybvliuuaeyvlaiuyalvwtlwuivyaliueyreliuyaleriutavluietyvalieuryarieuyval uewytaleiurtye.”
Dia Ceol: “I… see. That is quite tragic.”
Jim: “ I know no one else knows my true language, it's quite sad.”
Ryker: “Lol, no one?”
Ryker: “How’s the office?”
Jeff arrives at a lift
Rae: * starts walking around the office ignoring the narrator*
Cancer:*wakes up, crawls out of backpack, gives Rae lizard blinks, changes back to human form*
JIM: “really speak a coherent sentence in my language ryker.”
Cancer:”mmm no. no coherent sentences for you.”
Rae: “ Is that a thing when it comes to Ryker?”
Cancer:”I don’t think so”
Ryker: “I can speak less coherently.” 
Cancer:”und ich bebeive das ich will spek less cohererntlle”
Ryekr: “Ohlj;biy by gon it!’
Rae: “sbamesl//”
Jim: “ what do you mean that the cat's microwave vomited down the garbage disposal all while an anorexic grandmother loses tweety bird to world war 7.”
Cancer:”bwhoalt”
Ryker: *Points to the show he’s watching on his phone.”
Jim: “what the heck does this have to do with transformers?”
Ryker: *again points to the show hes watching on his phone*

*Waiter comes out to Rae’s table*
Waitris: “ What can I get for you love?”
Cancer:*continues raindancing and chanting*
Young Rae: * thinks hard for a moment* “ cheese cake, some cheese cake please.”
Waitress: * smiles* “ coming right up.”
Ryker: *eating popcorn, watching the fever dream*
Cancer:*snaps out of it, decides to ask ryker as to why*”why did you give us all fever dreams?”
Waitress: “ alright heres your food love.”
Young Rae: * something seems to change in her eyes. She suddenly jumps on the waitress, attacking her*

Jim: *destroys cancers fist and thanks ryker for the popcorn*
*Three boys enter the scene*

Ryker: *sighs and reforms fist*
Cancer: *regrows fist*
Jim: “ up next the bachelorette. Three boys try to woo a young woman.”
Cancer:*creeps up behind Rae*”No Jim they don’t, sorry to disappoint”
Ryker: *interested in plot line*
Second boy: “ it was perfect we got all of it.”
Cancer:*tilts head curiously, goes to investigate the boys to see what all of “it” was*
Jim: * starts to actually care*
Young Rae: “ but doesn't it feel wrong?”
First boy: * chuckles quietly* “ Rain, there's something you got to understand. this city is full of thieves and liars, you got to toughen up if you're going to survive.”
Second boy: “ and if you help us get more than you can get that polygots you wanted and add it to your collection.” 
Cancer: *returns to spot and watches*

Second boy: “ hey you did great Rain!”
Young Rae: “ thanks Kai.”
Cancer:*follows Rae*

Young Rae: * still doesn't hear him*
Cancer:*to ryker”me too I wonder why”*
Ryker: *ends fever dream* “NEXT TIME: Will Rae leave the thieves? Or will she betray them, or will we have different random fever dreams? Find out next time on: RAES FEVER DREAMS!”
Rae: * looks confused * “ what?”
Cancer:”Seriously, wow you really know how to kill a mood.”
Ryker: “Not him too!”
Mood: “Don't worry guys, I'm all right.”
Cancer:*kills mood*
Ryker: “You monster!”
Rae: *Is still confused* “ what happened?”
Cancer:”Ryker initiated a fever dream and we all had fever dreams and I told him that he knows how to kill a mood because he ended it in the middle of your dream, and then he created Mood and I killed him.”
Rae: “ What was my dream?”
Cancer:”It was you in a cafe and you ordered cheesecake and then you tackled the waitress, turned invisible and met up with some boys in a hall somewhere.”
Rae: *Turn pale* 
Cancer:”I faded into your dream so I could experience it with you. If you are wondering what my dream was it was about flying banana rocks and banana juice rain, and when i woke up i began rain dancing and changing and chanting chaotically”
Rae: * seems distracted* “ oh nice.”

Rae: “ ow, stop it!”
Cancer:”sorry, it shocked me and i tend to get violent”
Rae: “ its fine, but just so you know it doesn't come off so please don’t try.”
Cancer:”why doesn’t it come off? Was it attached to you when you were younger?”
Rae: * looks uncomfortable*“..... no reason.”
Cancer: “There is a reason because you don’t just attach things to people, I had this solid spren choker thing around my neck that would change with me and wouldn’t get larger if it got smaller, because I wouldn't listen to my masters in my universe. I also received a brand on my forehead denominating me as a slave as well from my “master” a fused warlord, the band was un-able to travers universes and was destroyed, the brand stayed, i hide it with my hair a lot.”
Rae:* avoiding question* “ oh interesting.”
Cancer: “you didn’t answer my question.”
Rae: “ I didn’t?”
Cancer:”no you didn’t and I would like it answered. Was it attached to you to keep track of you?”
Rae: * still avoiding questions* “ So what were you saying about your fever dream?”
Cancer:” i already told you, so why are you avoiding my questions, if you don’t talk about something it gets worse and worse and corrupts you.”

Rae: *jumps* “ oh hey, also if the others ask I’m not here.”
Ryker: “So, what was that, why were you stealing?”
Rae: “ Well it was a city full of low lives and criminals so you had to steal to survive.”
Ryker: “Why survive when you can thrive?”
Rae: “ the only way to thrive was if you were rich.”
Ryker: “And?” *pauses* “I don’t see the problem.”
Rae: “ I was most definitely not rich. In this universe monsters ruled most of the land so two major cities were made. One for the rich where they are happy and get plenty, and the second one was fighting for their scraps. If you couldn’t pay enough to live in the rich city, you were thrown into the second city. All the orphans when there too. But if you didn’t have enough, the town full of thieves wasn’t as bad as going outside the city walls.” 
Jeff: *unplugs the ringing tefalone*
Rae: * sits on the floor waiting for something to happen.
Continues to fidget with the mechanical watch*
???; “As Stanley picked up the phone, a white light engulfed him, filling him not just with radiance, but with hope. Hope for a life reunited once- Wait, oh goodness. Stanley, did you just unplug the phone?” *pauses* “No, that wasn't supposed to be a choice. How did you do that? You actually chose incorrectly? I didn't even know that was possible.” *thinks* “Let me double-check.” *papers rustle* “No, it's definitely here, clear as day. Stanley picks up the phone. He's taken to his apartment where he finds his wife and the two pledge themselves to one another. Music comes in, fade to white, roll credits. Not picking up the phone is actually somehow an incorrect course of action. how is that even possible? None of these decisions were supposed to mean anything.” *pauses* “I don't understand. How on earth are you making meaningful choices? What did you- Wait a second. Did I just see- No, that's not possible, I can't believe it. How had I not noticed it sooner? You're not Stanley. You're a real person. *sigh* I can't believe I was so mistaken. This is why you've been able to make correct and incorrect choices. And to think I've been letting you run around in this game for so long. If you've made any more wrong choices, you might have negated it entirely. It's as though you completely ignored even the most basic safety protocol for real world decision-making, or did you not grasp the severity of the situation? Well, I won't have that kind of risk on my watch. I'm going to stop the game for a moment so we educate you properly on safe decision-making in the real world. Please observe this helpful instructional video.”
Rae: * grabbes pieces of bark and begins weaving them in a circle*
Ryker: “Ooh! This is a good part.”
A Tv Screen covers everyone’s vision
Video Narrator: “Choice. It's the best part of being a real person, but if used incorrectly can also be the most dangerous. For example: In this scenario, a hypothetical real person named Steven has a choice. He could spend years helping improve the quality of life for citizens of impoverished third-world nations, or he could systematically set fire to every orphan living in a thirty kilometre radius of his house. Which choice would you make? Remember that unlike here, the real world makes sense and at no time should you make a choice that does not conform to rational logic. If you find yourself speaking with a person who does not make sense, in all likelihood, that person is not real. Allow the person to finish their thought then provide an excuse why you cannot continue talking. Turn to a partner and practice saying: "My goodness. Is it 4:30? I am supposed to be having a back sack and crack." Excellent. Making choices on a regular basis is the best part to a healthy decision-making process. Most medical professionals recommend making at least eight choices per day. Do you make more than eight? Less? And finally, if you begin to wonder if your choices are actually meaningful and whether you'll ever make a significant contribution to the world, Just remember, that in the vast infiniteness of space, your thoughts and problems are materially insignificant and the feeling should subside. At this time, your instructor will guide you in an exercise to test and reinforce the material covered in this video.” (Video)
Jeff: *sarcastically* “Hmmm… very helpful.”
Room appears degraded
???: “Ah, welcome back. You may have noticed that this room has begun to deteriorate as a result of narrative contradiction. But not to worry! Now that you're properly informed on good decision-making, we're going to revisit a choice you made just a few minutes ago and see what the correct thing to do would have been. This way please.” *leads back to two doors room*
Rae: *begins tying string around the circle* 
Jeff: *goes against everything the narrator says*
You arrive at the two doors room because everything else is blocked off
???: “Now, remember. All you need to do is behave exactly as Stanley would. That means choosing responsibly and always putting the story first. I'm quite sure you'll be up to the task. Just follow my lead and you'll be fine. Alright, *ahem.* When Stanley came to a set of two open doors, he entered the door on his left.”
Rae: * leaves three strings hanging at the bottom of the circle and begins adding beads.*
Jeff: *Goes right*
Rae: *Goes inside backpack*
???: “No! Why did you do that? Quickly, hurry back in the other direction! Perhaps we're not too late!”
Area blocked off due to “narrative contradiction”
Jeff: “Dang…” *goes back to the left door*
???: *clears throat* “Right, okay.” *pauses* “Yet there was not a single person here either. Feeling a wave of disbelief, Stanley decided to go up to his boss's office, hoping he might find an answer there.” *continues from meeting room* 
Go to the staircase?
Jeff: *goes to the staircase*
???: “Coming to a staircase, Stanley walked upstairs to his boss's office.”
Jeff: *Walks up the stairs*
Office is green instead of red
???: “Stepping inside his manager's office, Stanley was once again stunned to discover not an indication of any human life. Shocked, unraveled, Stanley wondered in disbelief who orchestrated this, until he saw the door with a voice receiver next to it. Surely, behind this door lay all the answers to his questions, and beyond all probability he knew the passcode. He had seen it on his boss's desk just last week. Night shark 1-1-5. Was this the code to open the door? Would it still work? There was only one way to find out. Stanley had been trained never to speak up, but now he would draw from within himself the courage to face the unknown. He drew a sharp breath and then spoke the code.” 
Jeff: *draws in sharp breath* “Night shark 1-1-5”
???: *flips pages again* “Wait..that’s not right! You can’t enter the code! That..?”
A drawer in the desk opens
???: “What’s that? Stanley! Please tell me what it is!”
There’s a slip of paper in the drawer that reads 
“Ryker, evil, wicked
Vile, lost to Mimick and Smile
Find where they had split”
There’s another slip in there as well
“Bright, Shining evil light
Sound throughout the universe
Where it all began.”
Ryker: *shocked* “Well that’s interesting. There’s your hint!” *teleports them all out of the temple*
Jeff: “Wait. Did everyone else just get the hint?”
Ryker: “Nope! Just you.”
Jeff: “Okay.” 
Ryker: “So..? Get the Gem?”
Jeff: “Um… I’m not good at traveling.” 
Ryker: *gives him LOZ Master Cycle 0* “You got a Master cycle! Buh duh du duh duh!”
Byker: *in squeakese* “So now what?”
Squeaker: *in squeakese* “What is that Ryker guy’s problem?”
Byker: *in squeakese* “The multiversal gem.”
Squeaker: *in squeakese* “We should get all of them before Ryker, you know where they are, don't you?”
Byker: *in squeakese* “No, that's the problem. How do we do that without getting interrupted.”
Squeaker: *in squeakese* “We somehow propel our dust particle towards them”
Byker: *in squeakese* “No! WE DON’T want them or we’ll be corrupted.”
Squeaker: *in squeakese* “We could destroy them” 
Byker: *in squeakese* “No we cant.”
Squeaker: *in squeakese* “Why?”
Speech below here is in squeakese
Byker: “Because you can’t break them.”
Squeaker: “Hmm… I know! We could get them all, give them to ryker then for our wish, We could wish something good for all squeak kind ”
Byker: “Do you want the universe to be destroyed?”
Squeaker: “Only sometimes”
Byker: “What about the Multiverse?”
Squeaker: “If we have them it'll corrupt us, if he has them he will destroy everything. So, how do we stop him?”
Byker: “I don’t know.”
Squeaker: “Mobile idle tycoon games?”
Byker: *clears throat* “How did you know about that?”
Squeaker: “Oh, I know EVERYTHING”
Byker: *concerned* “I wouldn’t recommend doing mobile idle tycoon games.”
Squeaker: “How come? Do you not like them?”
Byker: “No..I just wouldn’t try that.”
Squeaker: “Can he hear us conversing? Is he here right now?”
Byker: “Probably.”
Squeaker: “What do you mean probably?”
Byker: *shrugs* “He is doubting what we’re saying. He doesn’t believe it. He’s probably tuning us out.”
Ryker; *listening* “Nope.”
Squeaker: *Acting dumb* “squeak?”
Ryker: *rolls eyes* “Squeak to you too.”
Squeaker: “Okay, okay. Ryker let's get down to business”
Ryker: “What do you want?”
Squeaker: “I want nothing from your weak self, but I did get you something” 
Ryker: “Did you just call me WEAK?”
Squeaker: “Prove to me you aren't weak.” *Shows him a mobile idle tycoon game*
Ryker: “Close, but no cigar!” *makes Byker cease to exist* “Does that show you my power?”
Squeaker: “Not in the slightest. In fact, I was just about to do the same thing”
Ryker: *rolls eyes* “I’m done with you.” *teleports Squeaker to the void*
Squeaker: *Teleports ryker to the void as well* “Come on Rykeypoo, fight me like the “Strong” being you are!”
Ryker: “Are you sure?”
Squeaker: “Are you?”
Ryker: *chuckles* “This will be fun.” *snaps Squeaker out of existence*
Squeaker: *Reappears* “Thought it would be that easy?”
Ryker: *shrugs* “I had to try.” *makes millions of clones of himself And hides him in crowd*
Squeaker: “I overestimated you” *Snaps* *All Rykers disappear*
Ryker: *bored* “Hit me with your best shot.”
Squeaker: “Not until you do the same”
Ryker: “Why?”
Squeaker: “How am I supposed to know how much power I should use until I know what your measly power can do”
Ryker: “Just use all of it.”
Squeaker: “And if I don't?” 
Ryker: *shrugs* “I don’t care.”
Squeaker: “I'll start with something easy” *Surrounds Ryker with pure sodium then drops him into olympic size pool*
Ryker: *drinks all the water after eating all of the sodium before it touched the water*
Squeaker: “Curious” “I would have simply caused the sodium to have beta decay”
Ryker: *eats Squeakers sound waves*
Squeaker’s Sound Waves: “I… Am… Inedible!”
Ryker: “And I am Iron RAM.” *snaps*
Sharp Cracks are audible
Ryker: *total waves of Rykers rain on Squeaker*
Jim:  “Enough. Jeff, shall we teach these two people what the council can do.”
Jeff: “This isn’t our fight!”
Jim: “ fine”
Ryker: *In squeakese* “How about I just agree to give you a universe.”
Squeaker: “No”
Ryker: “How about now?”
Squeaker: “No”
Ryker: “Now?”
Squeaker: *Rolls eyes* “Ok” “But, It must be Jim”
Ryker: *gives him Jim*
Jim: *has had enough, star sword forms into existence in his hand*
Squeaker: “Actually I think I'll have a different universe”
Ryker: *hands Jim to him again* “Here you go.”
Squeaker: “Oh? A new Jim?”
Ryker: “Yeah, this one’s docile.”
Squeaker: “MUCH better”
Ryker; “I agree.”
Squeaker: “Why even keep the original alive?”
Ryker: “True.”
Squeaker: “What if we work together to eliminate Jim”
Ryker: *eats jim* “That should do it.”
Rae: *climbs out of backpack* *in squeakeses * “ SQUEAKER! YOU’RE ALIVE!!”
Ryker: “And apparently super op.”
Rea:” you didn't know that before?”
Squeaker: “Oh, I've always been OP”
Ryker: “No you.”
Rae: “ he's king of the pool univers of course he's OP.”
Ryker: “Tru dat.”
Rae: * seems to think of something else feeling accomplished.*
Ryker: “So why were you a thief anyway Rae?”
Rae: * doesn't really want to talk about it.*“ oh, to survive.”
Ryker: *bored* “How about we go find that gem now?”
Rae: “ no.”
Ryker: “Why?”
Rae: “ because I don't really want to.”
Ryker: “Then what do you want to do?”
Rae: “ I dunno.”
Ryker: “Eats donut.”
Rae: “ Why did you say ‘eats donut’?”
Ryker: “Doesn’t respond”
Rae: * is confused why Ryker keeps speaking his actions.*
Ryker: *how are you*
Rae: *???*
Ryker: *starts speaking in actions, how are you* “Laughs”
Rae: * is very confused and decides to start ignoring Ryker and work on something else.*
Ryker: *snaps her dreamcatcher in half* “What did I say?”
Rae: “ hey.” * there seems to be something else in her eyes though like she's hiding something.*
Ryker: “All right, hand it over.”
Rae:* looks confused.* “ hand what over?”
Ryker: *uses his dream catcher magnet power* “I never thought this would come in handy!”
Dreamcacher magnet:* finds no dreamcatchers.*
Ryker: *squints* “I see..”
Rae: * looks pleased with herself.* 
Ryker: “WHAT ARE YOU HIDING!” *getting annoyed*
Rae: * looks at him innocently.* “ nothing.”
Ryker: *snatches backpack* “Thank you.” *empties backpack*
Rae: * begins putting her stuff in her pockets and it disappears, looks pleased with herself.*
Ryker: *takes Lottie Darcy hostage* “If you don’t tell me..I’ll do it!”
Lottie Darcy: “What is the meaning of this!! HELP! HELP!”
Meanwhile, At the Master Cycle O
Jeff: *Hands on his hips, talking to Dia Ceol’s Mechanical Avatar* “I think you should.”
Avatar: “Hmmm… But Ryker…”
Jeff: *interrupts* “Probably won’t care.”
Avatar: “Okay…” *Disappears in a beam of light*
Ryker: “Care about what?”
Jeff: “This” 
A beam of light comes down and hits the Master Cycle, purifying it changing the colors to blue and white with golden highlights to become the Holy Cycle
Jeff: “See?”
Ryker: “Oh sure, I don’t care. Oh and you want to head..North, that way! You’ll come to a big crater. Go there.”
Jeff: “Alright” *Hops on his Holy Cycle and heads North*
He arrives at a large flaming crater
Ryker: “Well that’s interesting. This same crater’s in A1. How did it know?” 
Jeff: *Prays*
Dia Ceol: “Here you go.” *sends down a holy recorder (the instrument)*
Jeff: “Thanks” *Plays long, discordant, squeaky notes on the recorder* *Wind comes out, putting out the fire*
Ryker: “MY FIRE!”
Rae:* teleports Lottie Darcy and her backpack to her and then teleports away.*
Ryker: *teleports them back, and prevents their teleportation.* 
*doesn’t work, something is blocking Ryker.*
Ryker: “Okay what’s going on.”
THE Author: “They’re trying to stop you prematurely.”
Ryker: “I should be fine then.”
Jim: “ Hey wiziker, can I have the power to explore the void?”
Wiziker: “Sure.” *grants Power.*
Jim: *wanders around for a while before finding something.*
Ryker: *floats over to a spot in the crater and finds someone lying there.* “Huh. Interesting.”
S: “huh? Where am I, who are you?”
Ryker: “Pleasure to meet you, I’m Ryker!” *starts floating*
S: “oh i see, another superhuman planet” *makes smart alec face*
Ryker: *chuckles* “I’m not your average ‘superhuman’.” *starts juggling his flaming heads and eating magically appearing donuts*
S: *starts dying of laughter* “as you can tell i have quite the humor, anyway… what planet is this?”
Ryker: “Earth. Universe A2.”
S: “I see… and your name is… Ryker correct?”
Ryker: *nods*
S: “excellent”
Ryker: “So s, what do you do?”
S: “as in what?”
Ryker: “Powers, skills, etc.”
S: “oh” *thinks profusely* “well i'm nothing too special, but i have a special array of skills and assets”
Ryker: “All right. Neat.”
S: “how about you?”
Ryker: “All of them.”
S: *thinks of god*
Ryker: “Nah!” *laughs* “I just am all powerful.”
S: “I see, so i've read your mind over a few times and have discovered your looking for the universal gem, correct?”
Ryker: *blocks his mind off* “Yep! There should be one nearby!”
S: *thinks in mind, is he for real? Does he really know it's here?*
*a small creature comes out it looks like a mouse but slightly different, it has a kangaroo pouch. It makes a purring noise.* 
Ryker: “Kangaroo rat? Must be Rae’s.”
Creature: “ shiny?” 
Ryker: *hands it penny*
Creature: * snatches it.* “ shiny!” 
Ryker: *empties pockets full of different coins* “Here.”
Creature: “ shiny!” * takes it and puts it all in pouch* 
S: “it's strange that you give a mutant creature money”
Creature: “ ALL HAIL THE SHINY MASTER!!!” 
Ryker: “Why shouldn’t I?”
S: “ok first how is it gonna use money? And second, HOW THE FRICK DID THAT THING JUST TALK, I THOUGHT THIS WAS EARTH?!!!”
Ryker: “It is.”
Creature: * begins bowing to Ryker.* “ ALL HAIL THE SHINY MASTER!!!” 
S: *starts to slowly fly away*
Ryker: *freezes him* “I’ll deal with you in a bit.” *puts creature in shirt pocket”
S: “faaaaaaantastic” *says in a sarcastic voice*
Creature: * climbs out from the pocket and runs off shouting “ must please the shiny master!!!”
Ryker: *floats over to S* “Now what are YOU doing?”
S: “im entitled to tell you nothing, and as a mind reader myself i am not susceptible to having my mind read”
Creature: * returns with nuts and berries and places them in front of Ryker.* “ a sacrifice to the all powerful shiny master!!”
Ryker: *summons a duplicate of creatures species and consumes it instead*
Snitch: * looks offended.* “shiny master has broken his vow. He has killed our kind. He is no longer shiny master! He is MURDERER MONSTER!! Therefore HE MUST DIE!!!!!!” 
S: *thinks, how interesting* *chuckles*
Snitch: * jumps on Ryker attacking him.*
Ryker: *eats more ‘snitches’ like popcorn and brushes Snitch off.*
S: “gross ryker, just gross”
Snitch:* nocks bowl out of Rykers hand. “ BE FREE MY PEOPLE!!!!” 
Ryker: *takes control of their brains and makes them walk directly into his mouth*
Snitch: * bites neck sinking venom into Rykers neck.*  
S: “now this is getting INTERESTING”
Ryker: *drinks venom from his neck directly*
Snitch: * scratches Rykers face and bites it.* 
S: thinks in head *I wonder how much more interesting this could get with some necromancy?*
Ryker: “Let’s find out, shall we S?” *repairs face*
S: “YES WE SHALL” *GROUND STARTS TO SHAKE AND FORM CRACKS IN ITSELF AS SKELETON MONSTERS START COMING OUT OF THE CRACKS*
Snitch: * doesn’t care, continues to attack Rykers face*
Ryker: *looks at phone* “Turn down the evil, man!” *starts disintegrating skeletons*
Snitch: * steals Rykers phone and runs away.* “ what will you dos now that I have your preshouse cicky box?!” 
S: “aaawwwww, i thought we were having fun ryker?”
Ryker: *rolls eyes and teleports phone back to him* “That was fun!”
S: “lets do it again sometime! But without the holdbacks…”
S: “im going to be right back… i need to head to china for some…….. Important matters……………………….” *flys to china*
Ryker: “What’s a China?”
China does not exist in A2
S: “welp im back, turns out china doesn’t exist on this earth”
Ryker: *starts playing Pac-Man.*
S: *hears the sound of ryker playing pacman* *sighs* “yet pacman does”
Snitch: * diggs in pouch* 
Ryker: *brings shards up closer to his brain to prevent it from being stolen*
S: “Ryker, if you have shards of the gem… what are we really looking for?”
Ryker: “The rest of them.”
Snitch: * mutters* “ must find the shiny master….”
S: “fair enough, i might have a small idea of where they are”
Ryker: *gives Snitch a pocket dimension full of different currencies from different universes*
Snitch: * celebrates.* “ he has redeemed himself, HE IS THE SHINY MASTER!!” 
S: “one of my clan’s friend clans said they were hidden in a temple… i choose not to believe it since the whole clan were liars”
Ryker: “oh that temple just had a hint to this place.”
S: “interesting” *remembers that that clan killed s’s whole family which was his clan*
Ryker: “I wish.”
S: *Did he read my mind just now?*
Ryker: “Yes he did.”
S: “the frick, i thought it was impossible”
Ryker: “Everything’s possible for me.”
S: “And what do you mean I wish? That makes sense”
Ryker: “You wish that you had a decent upbringing.”
S: “nah, i just want REVENGE”
Ryker: “Okay, on who?”
S: “it is none of your concern, i will fulfill it when i am ready”
Ryker: “I’d just kill them.”
S: “kill them for me and i will unleash destruction you have never seen before, i warn you”
Ryker: “Why?”
S: “they are mine and mine alone, they killed everyone i ever knew, over a gambling bet… once i regain my full power i will unleash the power of demicro upon them”
Ryker: *shrugs* “Double or nothing?”
S: *stunned by rykers incompetence to listen*
Ryker: “Full power?”
S: “yes”
Ryker: “Which is..?”
S: “must i spell it out for you?”
Ryker: “You call me stupid, I know everything before you say it, but I let people talk.”
S: “then you should know what my full power is”
Ryker: “I like people to speak, I find it rude to interrupt.”
S: “at least you have quality and manners, i’ll give you that…”
Ryker: “Welp, if you’re so busy, I’ll let you be.” *floats off to find shard*
Snitch: “ shiny master!! Wait.” * looks sad.*

Ryker: “That is fun, isn’t it?”
Jim: “ I am a servant to master and masters master until I have earned my power and freedom.”
Snitch: “ Free?” 
Ryker: “Oh, free means to be oppressed by a shiny master.”
S: “here they come…”
Snitch: “ YOU CAN BE HIS SHINY MASTER!!”
Ryker: “If he wants me to!”
Jim: “master I need a nail to defeat my enemies will you give me the power to summon one?”
Cancer:”I don’t think that you are going to get a nail so you sould give up and use your shoelace”
Jim: “ master knows what I mean.”

Pac-Man: * still find nothing.*
Pac-Man: *gets gold sonic powerup, and turns into pure gold*
Ryker: *looks at phone* “And now the currency is golden pac-men.”
Pac- Man: * FINDS NOTHING!*
Pac-Man: “Waca-wac-waca.”
Cancer:*changes to dragon and incinerates the Pac-mans*
S: “what are you guys trying to find now? Is it still the gem?”
Ryker: “I give who ever gets a shard a wish granted, so I guess maybe.”
Cancer:*changes back to human* “So are we still looking for the gem or Rae. I guess the gem. 
S: *smiles deviously* “THE POWER I NEED”
Ryker: “Whichever you want. I dont care. The shard should be somewhere near here.”
S: *starts searching frantically”
Cancer:*decides that the temple is a waste of time and that it is probably not there so she changes to an eagle and flys  around till she finds her way out of the temple.*
Snitch: “ I WILL FIND THE RAE!!!”
S: *uses telekinesis to lift the ground itself*
Cancer:*voids through ground to lower level*
Ryker: *flies high up* “Well thats odd”
S: “I THINK I FOUND IT!!!!” *flies over*
Ryker: “Thats a rock.”
S: *WARNING WHAT S IS ABOUT TO SAY MAY SHOCK YOU* “BEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEP”
Cancer:*flies to S, knocks out S*
Ryker: *looks up* “There it is! Next to that cloud!”
S: *gets knocked out* *wakes up five seconds later* “your dead cancer… just wait”
Snitch: “ What is a Rae?”
Cancer:*changes to Eagle and voids through ceiling and finds that there are no clouds in the sky, returns to Ryker and S*
Ryker: “You must have your cloud rendering off.”
Cancer:*doesn’t get, glares at ryker*
Snitch: “ WHAT IS A RAE?!!!”
Ryker: “A ray is a beam of light.”
Cancer:”i don’t think that that’s what it wants”
S: *charges up kamehameha to destroy the ground* *fires kamehameha at ground all over*
Cancer:*summons armour*
It begins to rain, hampering all powers
Snitch: * Runs over to a ray of sunlight.* “ I FOUND THE RAE!!” 
Cancer:*changes to bird and flies above the clouds*
The cloud moisture disabled your powers, making you start to fall back down to Earth
Cancer:*stays with armor summoned lands just fine*
S: *grunts angrily* “I WANT THE SHARD AND I WILL DO ANYTHING TO GAIN IT” *summons an army of skeletons to find the shard*
Jim: “Everyone please stop, I don't know what is going on.”
Cancer:”then you won’t get it”
Ryker: *grabs gem shard for himself, and starts doing eeny-meeny-miny moe* “All right..” *ends on Jeff* “There ya go. You get the wish.” *absorbs gem shard*
S: *shocked that ryker had it the whole time* “Ryker, you just pissed me off, and this universe is going to regret it…”
Ryker: *eats S*
Cancer:*looks on blankly, unsurprised*
Snitch: “ Shiny master, I found the Rae!”
Cancer:*goes over to snitch to see if the snitch found rae*
Snitch:* gestures to the ray of sunlight.* “ The Rae!”
Ryker: “Good Job Snitch!”
Cancer:*glares*
Jim: “ master I would like the ability to stop all of this caos.”
Snitch: * Hugs Rykers ankle.*
Cancer:*gives jim questioning look*
Jim: “so much is going on it hurts me so much I just want it to stop.”
Cancer:”so you are saying that you have so little mental capacity that you can’t keep track of what is going on, no wonder your a slave to wiziker and ryker.”
Jim: *getting angry lifts off the ground. They have power over my main abilities but they cannot put reins on my other 2. 
Cancer:”its still raining and this isn’t very impressive just seeing you glare angrily and just sitting there.”
Jim: “ masters forgive me.” begins to destabilize the entire area before teleporting away. 5 second to detonation.
Ryker: *limiting everyones powers due to rain*

Ryker: “What are you doing?”
Jiker: “Guess”
Ryker: “Trying to get around my rules.”
L842: “  hi y'all.”
Jeff: “Sorry. I was trying to accept my wish earlier, but I couldn't. So, here it is: I wish to have my mind shielded from reading and tampering. That includes the Great Resets, and Ryker.” *nods*
Ryker: “Your wish is…granted.”
Jeff: “Thanks.”
Snitch: “ I WANT WISH!!!!!”
Cancer:*stares at snitch.*
Snitch: “ ME WANT WISH!!!!!!!!!”
Ryker: “Tough.”
Snitch:“PPPPPPLLLLLLLLLLEEEEEEEEEEAAAAAAAAAASSSSSSSSSSSEEEEEEEE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!”
Cancer:”I think that it is safe to say that all of us want a wish.”
Ryker: *rolls eyes* “Okay, first person to make a wish gets it granted.”
snitch: “ I WISH FOR SHINIES!!!”
Cancer:”I wish for immunity to mind tampering and resets”
Ryker: “Isn’t that just what Jeff wished for?”
Cancer:”it is handy and useful. And Snitch, here are some gold coins.”*hands snitch gold coins*
Snitch: “ SHINNNNNNNNYYYYYYYYYYYYYY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!”
Ryker: *suddenly concerned* “Wait..is this a part of Jokes plan?”

Hestuia: *sighs*
Snitch: “ SHINY MASTER!! IT'S THE LORAX!!!” 
Ryker: *laughs* “That’s like the 100th time someone’s said that.”
Hestuia: “Why am I still the Lorax!”
Snitch: “ LORAX! LORAX! LORAX!!”

Portal Opens
???: spit onto the ground.
Ryker: “Oooh! Here we go!”!”
???: “strange I haven't been to this area yet.”  “why are there no dreams”
Ryker: “Because I ate them.”

Cancer:*sees this through her in-between lens*
Ryker: “What’s your name anyway?”
Snitch: “ shiny?”

Cancer:*returns from in-between* “we should call you something embarrassing since you won't tell us your name”
Ryker: “I dub you Steve.”
Snitch: “ SHINY?”
???: *golden eyes flashing like flood lights. “Jsteve it, is the j is silent.”
Ryker: “I mean I guess you could be the Sandman..”
Cancer:*confusion*”Who's that? We don’t have a sandman in my Universe”
Snitch: “ SHINY!”
Ryker: “Oh, essentially, the sandman leaves children good dreams, and makes them happy.” 
Cancer:”oh ok”
Snitch: * tries to get the shinys.*
Jsteve: “ The sandman is a myth, there is no sandman.”
Ryker: “What do you call The BFG?”
Snitch: “ SHINY!!!”
Jsteve: “Roald Dahl's story?”
Ryker: “Yeah.”
Cancer:”then I will eat this story”
Ryker: “No. I eat things. Not you.”
Jsteve: “ What a strange place.”
Snitch: “SHINY!!!!”
Ryker: “You’re a strange place.”
Cancer:”I will still eat things”
Jsteve: * freezes snitch solid.* 
Snitch: * breaks free and does the same to Jsteve.*

THE Author: “Stop! This is the photo police! You’re under arrest! Put your hands up!”
Jsteve: “ well I'm going” *begins to fly away*
Jsteve: * does not find where he is looking for.
Cancer:*summons armour* “i don’t care”*walks off calmly as cow thing*
Ryker: *googles google, and then google google in google, and then googles goggles*
Cancer:*steals and munches phone again*
Ryker: “What did i do to deserve my phone from being consumed? Good thing I backed it up!” *pulls out another phone*
Cancer:”played pac-man and googled confusing things”
Ryker: *eats Cancer* “I FOUND A CURE!”
Cancer:*escapes rikers stomach, punches him*
Ryker: *sighs* “WHY DOESN’T ANYONE WANT TO BE EATEN!”
Jsteve: * still flying. “ You know this is so confusing. I am in an area with no dreams, a bunch of people with evident gifts, all of them acting like children. I mean I look 20 but I'm 14. But I act like 20. “
Ryker: “I’m about infinite years old, but I act insane.”
Cancer:”i guess i'm like 19, i think and i'm still nutty”
Snitch: “7!” 
Cancer:*takes snitch and puts her upon head*
Snitch: “ I AM THE ALL POWERFUL TALL ONE!!!!!”

Snitch: * is confused* 
Jsteve: “yo I'd like to go back.”
Ryker: “Back where?”
Snitch: “ hhhhooooommmmeeeeee.” 
Jsteve: “ that is confidential. If you dont know what place this is either your stupid or Im not there.”
Ryker: “We’re at an alternate version of a crater where I was split.”
Jsteve: “ and that means?”
Ryker: “You’re probably in the wrong place.”
Jsteve: “ okay”
Snitch: “ go home!” 
Jsteve: “ well if you're going to be so mean about it maybe I will. Realizes he doesn't know how to go home.”
Ryker: “Says what he’s doing.”
Snitch: “ i not MEEEAAANNNNNN!!!!”
Jsteve: “ you were yelling at me to go home.” 
Ryker: *floating on back, waiting for them to go through the portal*
Snitch: “ YOUS said you were in wrong place so the right place is HOME, so Ies told you to go tos the right place which is the home.”
Cancer:*picks up and holds snitch above head like simba*
Snitch: “  AhHhHSaVAiNiEa.”
Cancer:*drop kicks snitch really high*
Snitch: * levitates right after being kicked and attacks Cancer face.*
Cancer:”you were supposed to go weeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee”

Pi: *Joins team.*
Ryker: *drop kicks himself* “Weeee.” *sarcastic*
Snitch:* creepy* “ bye bye little guy!”
Pi “what do we do now?
Cancer:*glares*
Ryker: *appears* “OOOOOH! Another new character!”
Pi *Ctrl A, Backspace*
Pi “I shall divide you all by Pi. Ryker R-Y-K-E-R that is 5/3.141592653589793238462643383279502884197169399375105820974944592307816406286208998628034825342117 equals 1.591549431”
Snitch: * dropkicks Ryker. creepy.* “ Bye bye little guy.”
Pi “I am quite sure that we will see Ryker everywhere.”
Cancer:*is confusion*
Pi: “Jsteve: * deletes all that to save space.*
Ryker: “Well actually R-Y-K-E-R = 77, therefore, 77/π is estimated to be around 24.50986124 so boom.” *smiles* “Are you just a calculilinimator?”
Jsteve: * violently deletes the concept of pi.*
Ryker: “So you’re Jesteve then?”
Snitch: * revives Pi to annoy jsteve.*
Jsteve:'' no “ lights all things that ever had pi on them on fire and killing the person who thought of it and erasing it from everyone's memories making it so no one can revive pi
Snitch: *revives Pi.*
Jsteve: * takes snitch to his home.*
Jsteve: “ you have reached a place where I control everything. “ * deletes snitches powers.*
Snitch: * laughs because it didn’t work because even in this universe Snitches powers are far greater than Jsteves also that the Snitch in front of Jsteve was not the real Snitch but a clone*
Jsteve: * looks at her clone.*
Pi: “Should we continue our journey for the Universal Gem.”
Squeaker: “Yes”
Jsteve: “okay” * sends snitches clone back, restoring her powers*
Snitches clone: “ yay!”
Snitch: “ Now my clone has her powers back!”
Snitch: *makes it rain shinys.*
Jsteve: * is okay with this
Snitches clone: * makes two Pis*
Jsteve: *looks at the snitch, creates a clone and say she had it the whole time..*
Snitch: “ No i makese the Other mes when yous tried to takes me away but instead yous tools the other mes.”
Jsteve: “ the problem with that logic is that the clone would have had to have been made seconds before entering foo but The travers would have killed all non born creations like clones or golems.”
Snitch: “ I frozes time and then swicheded me for the other mes and i turneded invisible and the other mes protected hers self froms the travleses.”
Snitches clone: “Yep!”
Jsteve: “ you do realize in order to protect someone from traveling to foo They couldn't make it to foo right.”
Snitches clone: “ that's a strange ting cus i travled justs fines.”
Jsteve: “no you were just made.” 
Snitches clone: “ ya i wases made rights befor youses sent mes to the others place.”
Jsteve: “Then  you died and were recreated.”
Cancer:”I think that I will have to agree with Jsteve on this one, its unrealistic”
Jsetve: “thank you cancer.”
Cancer:”I think that it is unrealistic, and in all reality, for whatever realities worth, it is. 
Snitch and clone *??????????????????????????????????????!????????????????????*
Jsteve: “it means you're wrong.”
Ryker: *nods* “Makes sense.”
Snitch: “ NO!” * incinerates Jsteve.* 
leven: *Look at her. “Are you my relative?”
Ryker: *incinerates a mini donut* “It got powder on my fingers.” *starts eating cheetos* “What? I like Cheeto dust.” *makes Cheeto dust fly from his hands into his mouth*
Snitch: * steals a donut. Kidnaps Geth.* “ Hello little stick man.* 
Leven: “ Why did you steal him? You know he will remain ever the optimist and can't be killed unless fate says so.”
Snitch: “ Ies is not trysing to kills him, Ies wantses a tinncy stick mans for me selftind.” 
Leven: “he's not a toothpick any more.”
Snitch: * turns Geth into toothpick.* “ Now hes is.” 
Fate: * no you don't.*
Snitch: “ yes I do!”
Leven: “ hahaha” “no matter how strong you can't beat fate.”
Cancer:”i think that you can beat fate, as fate, is an imaginary thing”
Leven: “brought to life by the power of dreams.” which gives it limitless power.
Cancer:”please explain”
Squeaker: “I don't like my dreams”
Leven: “ well it is dreams therefore powered by itself as well as the imagination of infinite beings. Foo is special because there is only one realm of foo on any plane of existence: universal multiversal and multimiltiversal and on. Therefore it is powered by all beings. It has so much power. And as they want I have full access to all of the power.”
Snitch: *Eats the rest of Rykers donuts.*
Ryker: *annoyed* “No shinies for you.” *makes it so everything shiny Snitch touches turns to stone*
Snitch: * undoes this so she can now touch shinnys without them turning to stone.* 
THE Author: “All right guys. This is enough. My character has a logical backstory on why he has his powers. Please tell me yours if you want them to keep their ‘powers’”
Ryker: “Thank you!”
Snitch: “ the bad men gave them to mes.”
Ryker: “How is that a reason?”
Leven: “read the leven thumps series.”
Author: * prevents Ryker from erasing Snitches powers.* 
Cancer:*voids from A2 to another universe to go wander in Z13 for a while*
Leven: * eats a taquito*
Snitch: * Teleports away.*
Ryker: *sighs* “Why are you all such IDIOTS!” 
Leven: * enters a coma*
Snitch: * is sad she can’t bug Leven anymore.*
Snitch: * Begins setting fire to S.O.U.R HQ.*
Ryker: *makes everything Snitch does obsolete*
Snitch: * mutters something about having to do something soon and then starts ripping up ground with her paws.*
*Suddenly bright colorful lasers appear followed by rave music. A duck with bat wings and ears, with gold sunglasses, a flashy sash and fancy gold cane makes her entrance. She is clearly rich and likes to make a big entrance.*
Bduck: “ greetings lower life forms I am Who the bduck, but I am also known as badonkadonk.” 
Snitch: * is too busy ripping apart the earth to notice who’s flashy entrance.* 
Who: “ I am the goddess of wealth and Minecraft spawning eggs!” 
Ryker: *laughs* “Lower life forms?” *spawns ender dragon just to spite Bduck*
Who: “ pfff I’m the goddess of spawning eggs I’m not scared of your dragon.” 
Ryker: “But can you spawn it?” *spawns firework rocket and evoker fangs*
Who: *spawns a turtle-duck-warden-dragon.*
Ryker: “All right.” *spawns a turtle-duck-warden-dragon-wither*
Snitch: * rips a piece of dirt that flies over almost hitting Ryker and who.*
Ryker: *looks over* “Don’t dig too deep.” *smiles*
Snitch: * Has dug around 8 feet into the earth and is continuing to dig.*
Who: * spawns a demogorgon-dragon.*
*creations begin fighting, the world begins to lag.*
Leven: * wakes up * after a few minutes of confusion talks to geth before geth disintegrates.*
Leven: *eye blaze as fire bursts through them.
Joke: * sees what's happening.*
Ryker: *adds more RAM to universe to lower lag, then teleports to Joke*
Snitch: * begins jerking in pain like she’s being electrocuted.*
Ryker: *increases RAM*
Snitch: * continues to have a seizure.* 
Who:* creates a dragon-warden- enderman-turtle- shark- bat - zombies- Capri-skeleton-frog.* 
Leven:  “ENOUGH” * everything stops as all time stops except for those he chooses including Ryker, Joke, Jeff, and Squeaker*
Ryker: “So what powers do you have exactly?” *starts messing with peoples faces and positions*
Leven: “How do you not know? That side character Jeff knows.”
Ryker: *shrugs* “I do, I just don’t like to be rude. So..” *clears throat* “What are your powers?”
Leven: “ take a wild gander.”
Ryker: *sighs* “Being annoying?”
Leven: “ Well, that's not very nice. I am the embodiment of the future. I chose what it is.”
Ryker: *Sneezed* “Sorry, but no.”
Leven: “What is denying the truth going to do for you.”
Ryker:  “I control time.”
Squeaker: “I can, on good days”
Ryker: “If all of us can control time, then how is time okay?”
Leven/fate: “I allow you to control me and I see no reason to change that.”
Ryker: “If ya had a chance to change ya fate, would ya?” *smiles*
Fate: I'm sorry. I can't operate directly against you as you need to stay exactly the same as you are.”
Ryker: “Did no one get the reference?”
Snitch: *continues to die.*
Ryker: *smiles* “Gogurt.”
Snitch: * eyes glow.* “ beware!” 
Snitch   *explodes.*
Ryker: *happy*
This is the meeting that happens in A2 between Jake and Ryker all other  characters are sent to A3 because Jake does not want others to interfere with his meeting.
Ryker: “Here.” *takes them to a pocket dimension away from eavesdropping and returns the rest to where they were on A2* “Now what do you want?”
Jake: “Ryker I have called you here for this meeting because I have one final thing to say to you before I die because I figured you would want to hear this.”
Ryker: “Die?”
Jake: “You see when I was gone I experienced many things and I discovered that I have a greater purpose in life fate has called me to do it so I figured I should”
Ryker: *chuckles* “No. I’m not done with you yet.”
Joke: “Do not worry I will be back just in a different body”
Jake begins to lift up in the air and so do all people who Jake has selected to say what he is saying Ryker also floats up but he has a strong enough will to resist saying what Jake says.


Joke: “This is the final spell I cast in this body so listen to it loud and clear: I speak in place for fate and all those who can control the future all of time will reset to this point no matter what happens, the past can not ever change again it can only be learned from this spell may kill me but I will live on in another form this spell can not be cast ever again
 SOUR will fall in the next few years, Ryker will lose his powers shortly after, His fall will be white as the keys of a piano, Black as the darkest night, and red as a fallen heroes blood, Mr. Moonlark will be able to rest peacefully in his grave once again” *Jake then falls to the ground barely breathing*
“Ryker you will not die your power will for a time but I am afraid you will be back one day. Just as powerful as you where before”
Jake: *Begins to fade atom by atom then all the world around him dose to*
Ryker: *laughs* “Oh really? Oh no! I lost my powers!” *teleports around*
Ryker: *Finds that no matter how hard he trys he can not seem to leave*
Ryker: “Good thing I have my backup.”
Ryker tries to escape but he is trapped then he is knocked unconscious and then later finds himself in a bed. When he tries to use his powers he finds that he can barely manage a spark without getting a headache worse than he has ever had, then he is knocked out again by the strain.
Ryker: *stabs himself*
You see Ryker die, almost to a point of demise, then cease to exist. He then reappears.
Ryker: *clears throat* “Well great!”
Scientist: “Well well well you thought that would work time resets to that point again”
Ryker: *squints* “I…know you..?”
Scientist: “Well of course you do I am sharing a concissnes with Jake but no that is not what you mean you know me from something else care to take a guess”
Ryker: *smiles and grabs something from his backpack* 
It appears to have a mix of ashes in a tube, along with two nozzles
Scientist: “Well that is funny I remember this you really think I would not have searched you while you where unconsins I scterd those ashs”
Ryker: *ignoring him* “Oh, that doesn’t matter, it’s already charged” *shoots himself with device*
You see a flash, and Ryker begins to split, and you see the gun disappears, and two forms are there, a girl and a boy.
??? (Boy): “Where..am..I?”
Scientist: “I did not think he would be so rash and do it no matter you are at my lab I was jus…. ”
Boy: *interrupts him* “What did you do to Mimick? And what happened to me..what year is it?”
Scientist: “First I am sorry to say but ryker killed mimick the year is curintly 50341 in this realm”
Boy: “Okay..so 10 years? That makes me..20? Sorta? What your name anyway.”
Girl: *silent throughout conversation*
Scientist: “My name is kind of hard to say in your language but you can just call me Scientist it is what my name roughly translate to”
Boy: *rolls eyes* “Let me guess..idiot?”
Scientist: *Waves hand and Boy can not speak no matter how hard he tries*
Boy: *immune to all forms of spells, abilities, and actions* “Whatever idiot. The names Snape. Nice to meet you. I’m gonna go now.” *starts to leave*
He finds that evry time he opens the door it just leads back to this point
Scientist: “Sorry my master put a curse on the door, It can not be undone until you both tell me exactly what you remember from before all this happened.”
Snape: *clears throat* “Well my sister..she doesn’t talk much anymore. But I guess you can say I was created when Ryker got trapped in the void by Mimick, and Ryker kinda didn’t exist for about 10 years. Your welcome. I did ya a favor.”
Scientist: “Well I already knew that but I mean what during thouse 10 years when we lost track of you.”
Snape: “We were raised by Mimick. Obviously.” *rolls eyes* “What do you want anyways?” 
Scientist: “I need you here because I am afraid that I need both of your help, Ryker has seemed to have began his emergency contingency plan which luckily I had planned for, I need help trying to obtain an object”
Snape: “Do you think I don’t know what a villain sounds like?” *pauses* “But I don’t get it. We don’t have..anything.”
Scientist: “First of all I am not a villain, second of all what I need is something you do not have. I need someone to help me with a spell.”
Snape: “The shards? Copy spell? We’re not your people. I refuse to help you.” *sits on ground defiantly*
Scientist: “I just need help transferring some power into an object the power that went into me I can not handle”
Snape: “Well we can’t help you. We don’t have Ryker’s powers.”
Scientist: *Rolls eyes* “No the spell is not at all special all it requires is that you hold me stable while I cast the actual spell”
Snape: “Get a chair or something. I don’t care for you. Maybe if you let us out ‘non-villian’”
Scientist: *Rolls eyes* “I do not think you understand. I am just as stuck as you are, my master put me under this spell also I can not leave until I cast the spell either.”
Snape: “Tough.” *pulls out phone and gets text message* “How did he? Wow. I mean, I guess. Sis?”
Girl: *silent*
Snape: “All right then. I guess so. Rae? Is there someone named Rae near here? I’m looking for a Rae?” *turns to Scientist* “So you’ll let me out here if I do your stupid spell?”
Scientist: “I’ll do more than that. I will take you to Rae.”
Snape: “What’s this spell exactly?”
Scientist: “The spell in particular is to help keep me from being overwhelmed by all the power that went into me when I died sort of” *He says in a different voice that sound almost exactly like Jake* “The spell will transfer all of the power of Jake into an object of my choosing because currently Jake is like a voice talking in my head and his power is currently being shared with me so I will be sending Jake and all of his power into a different object. Because like I said before I can barely manage to stand because one being is not meant to hold too much power at once.” *Pauses* “Also, if you really want to know my real name is Один知るかایٹم”
Ryker got the achievement: Now there are 2
Jake got the achievement: Now you are somewhat dead
Snape: “You know what. Fine. But I get to pick the object, Mr. Gibberish.”
Girl: *glares at Snape*
Snape: “What!”
A kind looking boy walks in threw the door. 
Fate “hello snape hello scientist. He walks to the girl. “
쉬고 많이 겪은 꼬마야 쉬고 나중에 얘기해
Girl: *looks at Fate, then sticks her tongue out.*
Fate * with a kind look touches her on the forehead. A serene look overcomes her.
Girl: *shakes it off* “Idiot.”
Fate : *gets slightly annoyed. It's a gift, please do not resist.
Girl: *irritated* “You’re a gift. Leave me alone.”
Fate: *takes a deep breath* “Please let me help you.”
Girl: “No.” *steps away* “Anyone who helps me gets hurt.”
Fate: “ I'll help you, I know it for sure.”
Girl: “Yes, but then you’ll be hurt. Everyone gets hurt.” *she looks like she’s having a flashback*
Fate: * looks at her kindly. Touches her arm lightly. * i wont be hurt and I need your help.
Girl: “I have a curse, okay? Just leave me alone.”
Fate: “ i know that.”
Girl: “I know my fate already. To be unimportant, and return to being Ryker.”
Girl: *summons Wiziker* “Been a while hasn’t it?”
Wiziker: “Who what when where why how?”
Girl: “Not important. Just grab your friends to get me out of here.”
Wiziker: *summons random  wizard*
Simon got the achievement: im baaack!
Simon: “I am not a wizard, I'm a magician!”
Simon: “and right now I'm incognito. You can call me simon macallister”
Girl: “Just help me escape.”
Simon: “okay. Since your a girl right now i can make you float.
Simon: “all of my tricks have to be related to stage magic so you have to be a girl or an escape artist or a judge in order to float.
Snape: “Well thats lame.”
Simon: *gets angry*“You're  one to talk, you got killed by a snake.”
Snape: “Who do you think I am?”
Simon: “sorry thought you were someone else”*embarrassed*
Snape: “Who?”
Simon: “are you not super snape the tv show character from the 80’S?”
Scientist: “leave us fate you are not needed”
Snape: *hands Scientist a small spider* “this.”
Scientist: “This object will not work Plase the object chosen is already mostly ready”
Snape: *picks up his phone* “Why not this?”
Scientist: “Because the object I am using is Already mostly bound”
Snape: “Fine.” *grabs hold of Scientist* “Now what?”
Scientist: “actually you just need to keep holding me like this while I say the incantation”
Snape: “Lets get this over with.”
Scientist: “Says incantation” “You may leave now Thank you”
Snape: *let go right before last word*
 Scientist ”It doesn't matter that was just to make it less painful Now leave me”
Simon: “I don't really understand what's going, on but does anybody want to see a magic trick?”
fate.* leaves server*
Simon: *is completely ignorant* “Does anybody want to see a magic trick!”
Scientist: “Leave! all of you!!!!!”
Simon: “why?”
Scientist: *Waves hand and they are all sent back to A2*
Scientist: “And stay out” *Looks tired and goes to a grand piano in the next room over and begins to play the bound theme*
Snape: “Whatcha doin?”
Scientist: “ I thought you would’ve left by now But pretty much what I am doing it is testing out if Jake is truly bound to the piano and it appears to have worked”
Snape: “You told me you’d tell me where Rae is.”
Scientist: “First I need you to make an oath to not harm her or expose her in ent way”
Snape: “Oh yeah sure whatever. I promise not to hurt Mimick, or Rae.”
Scientist: “Okay fallow me” *Walks to a device on the wall and then he presses a button and it teleports them to Rae’s location*
Snape: “All right then.” *pulls out phone* “We’re here Ryker, now what?”
Scientist:*Laughs* “ i’m afraid that won’t work here no magic works here, not even electronics trust me I was trapped hear once”
Snape: *gets text on phone* “It seems to work just fine.”
Scientist:”Well of course it works here we are not there yet It will still take some time for me to send you there ”
Snape: “all right then.” *gets text* “Wow. Great timing!” *pauses and reads text* “Okay then.”
Scientist: “ just so you know, this won’t actually take you to raes location it will just allow you to communicate with her”
Snape: “Well that won’t work.”
Scientist: “ not even that, I know where she is, you'll have to ask her for the location when you can communicate to her only. That information was destroyed and that piece of information was destroyed along with him”
Snape: *shrugs* “All right then.”
Scientist: “ just give it like one more hour before we’re there hopefully” 
Snape: *starts playing pacman on his phone*
Scientist: “ hey, I remember that game I used to love that game”
5 hours later
Scientist: “We are here”
????: “The person who want to communicate with the protected one must speak their wishs and must tell the word spoken to him”
Scientist: “You must say what your wish to do here is and then I will put in the code”
Snape: “Um to live? And to talk to Rae? Yeah that’s it. Pretty much, and to make a deal. Yeah. Pretty much it.”
Scientist: “That should do. the code is amazing anti point”
????: “Correct”
Then a door in the wall opens
Scientist: “Inside there will be a well in the center of the room. Through a coin in the well and say ‘Rae I wish for you to contact me’ This will allow you to contact her, I must warn you that you must not try to use any spells to track where that person is including reading their mind or you will find that the door that lets you escape will disappear.”
Snape: “I don’t have a coin.”
Scientist: *rolls eyes* “I was going to give you the coin also it is a very specific coin” *Gives him a coin with a strange pattern on it and words in a language that was so ancient that all but one person had forgotten about*
Snape: *walks into room and throws coin down the well and say Rain*
A figure rises out of the well made of mist she is mostly transparent
Rae: * looks confused.* “ Wait, what? We’re am I?” 
Scientist: “This connection will only last 30 minutes”
Snape: “Hi. Im Snape. So..Ryker doesn’t exist anymore.”
Rae: “ what?!”
Scientist: “The Ryker anomaly was split in 2, they wanted to communicate with you.”
Snape: “Yes.” *clears throat* “I need to speak to Mimick.”
Rae: “ ummm… I don’t know how you can speak to the being living inside me.” 
Scientist:”To communicate with him you need to use another coin”
Snape: “But he’s in her.”
Scientist:”Yes but still you need to for it to work” *Hands him another coin.*
Snape: “Well then..I guess..” *throws another coins in* “Mimick.”
Scientist: “There. That should work”
Rae becomes slightly more substantial
Scientist: “all you have to do is wave your hand and say Mimick you can speak in place of me.”
Snape: *waves hand* “Mimick.”
Scientist:”No not you, Rain needs to”
Rae: “ What did you just call me?!”
Scientist: ”Your name” 
Rae: * looks down.* “ My name is not Rain.”
Scientist:”Yes it is”
Rae: * looks at Snape.* “ Also I’m sorry but I’m not going to let you talk to Mimick.” 
Snape: “Why?”
Rae: “ Well I’m not exactly comfortable with you talking to the being inside me.” 
Snape: “Um..what do you want me to do about it?” *pauses* “If I don’t talk to him..it may cause some..problems..for all of us. I’m sorry but I really need to speak to him.”
Scientist: “There is one other way to communicate with Mimick, it is rather dangerous but it will allow you to contact him.”*Pauses*”It will also require me to use another coin”
Fate: *hands him one* “there you go.”
Snape: “Um okay?”
Rae: “ please no.” 
Scientist: “Do not worry Rae it will not affect you in any way all you need to do is throw that coin in the well with a piece of ash from Mimck. luckily, I have some with me” *Pauses* “Oh yes I almost forgot I also will need to bind the objects to each other” *Takes the coin from Snape and binds the ash to the coin with a spell* “Now just throw the coin into the well and say ‘the one who was lost is back with this coin’, it will last for about 45 minutes before the connection is broken” *Scientist feels fate watching* “Ahh, fate I thought I felt your presence. Show yourself. My master has a message for you” *Pauses* “Fate. You know that my master has a message for you, so why do you hide?” *Pauses for a few seconds* “I will give you to the count of 5 before I make you reveal yourself: 5, 4, 3, 2, 1” *Waves hand and a figure comes out the figure is fate*
Fate: *Looks at him annoyed*
Scientist: “My master would like you to hear this message: 
Mr. Moonlarks last composition was not destroyed, it is at the place where past and future meet. That is all” *Pauses* “So now all you have to do is throw the coin into the well”
The coin now has mimcks face on the side of the coin and the words on the coin change to different words still in the same language.
Fate: *stares at Mimick making him uncomfortable.*
Simon: “say where did Girl go?”
Rae: “ What girl? Also who are you?”
Simon: “ I mean how Ryker was turned into Snape and Girl. Also I’m simon Magician extraordinaire”
Rae: “ sooooooooo you're a wizard?” 
Snape: *throws coin in well* “Sorry.”
Rae: *sighs.*
A figure rises out of the mist his features where blurred and he was in a dark cloak
???: “Scientist, I thought I told you it was not safe to talk to me through this form”
Scientist: “This is the only way we could talk to you, Rain would not allow you to communicate through her.”
Mimick: “Well there is not much we can do now, what do you need?”
Scientist:*Waves hand and Simmon was sent to the farthest reach of A14*
Fate: * keeps looking at him.*
Mimick: *still slightly annoyed notices Snape* “Snape? What are you doing here? How do you exist? What happened to Ryker?”
Scientist: “Ryker split himself because he is worried about a proficy that Jake created”
Mimick: “All right whatever..” *turns to Snape* “So why are you here?”
Snape: “Well, um..Ryker told me that I have to ‘free you’”
Scientist: “Crap I do not have enough coins to do that with me.”
Snape: “Hand them to my sister.”
Scientist: “It is fine let me just grab some more” *Telaports back to lab and grabs enough*
Snape: “Just hand one to her.” *annoyed*
Scientist: “Hear you go, Just through them in and say Mimick I releas you and then I will do the rest of the spell”
Snape: *looks at well* “How long will this last?”
Scientist: “This will last around 1 year then he will be returned to his previous state unless who ever trapped him undose the spell binding him to rae but that spell is so old and so powerful that only ryker and me could potentially do it but even then.”
Snape: *gets text* “Ryker says that all I have to do to unbind Mimick from Rae is to, and I quote, ‘drink him.’”
Scientist: “Yes and no, that will make Mimick inhabit your body instead of rae though I could unbind him and give him back his own body if you would like.”
Snape: “Oh. Sure. Let me just.” *looks at Girl* 
Girl: *teleports away and reappears with splitter ray* “Great now what.”
Snape: “It says..to find Mimick, Smile, and Meh. We’ve got Mimick.”
Scintest: “Hear I have all of there ashes right hear” *Gives them a peace of each of there ashes.*
Snape: “Not Mimick’s ashes. Mimick.” *looks at phone* “Can we go to your piano now?”
Scientist: “I will bring it hear and bring them back.” *Disapears in cloud of smoke and comes back with grand piano*
Mimick: “Fancy.”
Scientist: “Now what I need you to do is to lay out a peace of there ashes around the piano and I will do the rest”
Snape: “I mean…or we could try and summon Smile from the piano.”
Scientist: “That is what this spell dose is summon them”
Snape: *uses coin he pocketed and hands it to Girl* “Duplicate it.”
Girl: *Duplicates coin numerous times and hands them back to Snape*
Scientist: “Now this is a little different you need to throw all of the coins in and say there names and I will play the peace that will summon them out of the well”
Snape: *ignoring Scientist* “All right.” *throws coins in well.* “Smile.”
Scientist: *Begins to play A peace on the piano that sounds haunting and dark*
Snape: *Gets text* “No Ryker, you’ve already got a theme.”
Then out of the well a figure comes out that is fully tangible he seams to be in a blue robe.
Snape: *confused* “Odd? Okay then..and then all he says is to hold the ray with Mimick and Smile.”
Smile: “Who are you? Where am…”
Snape: “Oh shut up.”
Smile: “All right then. Ryker I’m assuming.”
Snape: “I guess. Sorta.”
Smile: *grabs gun*
Mimick: “Welp, here we go!” *grabs gun*
Snape: *shoots ray at all 4 of them (including girl)
Scientist: “That will not do anything you are all intangible”
Ignoring the scientist, the description writer decides something interesting happens…
Ryker: *appears*
Mimick: *split from Rae*
Smile: *split from piano*
Girl and Snape: *unaffected*
Ryker: *looks at Mimick and Smile* “Well, nice to have you guys back.”
Mimick: “Well then..um..I’m gonna go…”
Scientist: “Hello Ryker, Mimick, Smile, Now we are just missing Meh and it will be a whole reunion”
Ryker: “Meh’s right in front of you.”
Mimick: *leaves area*
Scientist: “Ohh, I did not relise that”
Smile: “Well…now I’m done…” *grabs hold of Mimick and teleports away*
Girl: *teleports her and Snape to Mimick*
Ryker: *teleports away*
The Author: “Whoa. That was…a lot.”
Present Author: “The family reunion was separated… I was going to bring cookies”
Ryker: *clears throat* “So…Animal Crossing anyone?”
Scientist: “I have nothing better to do so okay”
Meanwhile in Universe A1
Mimick: “so..are we going to my castle? Or?”
Smile: *shrugs*
Snape: “Welp. Um. I guess we could try and stop Ryker..like we always do..”
Girl: *shrugs* “Sure.”
Axolotl: *appears* “Well, I can help with that…” *teleports them all away*
???(Jake’s): “That seems intresting” *Follows them*
Is sadly blocked and sent back to his lonely mannor in a far away land.
Axolotl: *makes them appear in [redacted]*
Snape: “Well then..now what?”
Axolotl: “We go get the shard. In order to get back here all you have to do is [redacted].” *teleports them to SOUR*
Fate: *teleports with them to continue to stare at mimick*
Axolotl: *arrogantly blocks Fate* “Well, moving on..” *teleports to Wiziker*
Wiziker: “Axolotl? Mimick? Smile? Snape? *coughs*” 
Scientist: “So… are you all willfully coming to the family reunion he says in all of there heads”
Every Ryker Related Character: *ignores Scientist*
Fate: *follows them dispute the blocking.*
Snape: “No, im Bob.”
Wiziker: “That was sarcasm..right?”
Snape: *still sarcastic* “No.”
Wiziker: “Is that sarcasm?” *pauses* “Ya know what? I don’t care. What do you want?”
Axolotl: “Your hat.”
Wiziker: “Why?”
Axolotl: *takes hat* “Yes.”
Wiziker: *annoyed* “Just give it back.” 
Axolotl: *rips hat apart and grabs shard, then reforms hat*
Wiziker: “There was a shard..? There?”
Axolotl: “Welp! Time to erase your mind!”
Wiziker: “Wait..wha..”
Axolotl: *erases Wizikers memory of this meeting and teleports away with the ‘Ryker Clan.’*
Mimick: “So now we use the shard against Ryker right?”
Axolotl: *exclaims* “No! If we use the shard, we’ll become corrupt like him! I’ve got a special place for the shard.” *sends shard to [redacted]*
Rae: * is there but invisible so no one knows.* 
Girl and Axolotl: *turn to Rae*
Girl: “I can see you.”
Rae: *mutters something.*
Girl: “What’d you say?”
Rae: * turns visible.* “ nothing.” 
Snape: “How did you even find us?”
Meanwhile
Scientist: *Begins to play a new song on the piano and the air in front of him seems to have a black tear in it. As he plays the tear seems to get larger and more powerful*
Four figures step out of the rift they are all in cloaks
Scientist: “Brothers, thank you all for coming to this meeting” *pauses* “We are the last remaining torivors in all of the multiverse and beyond.”
Trillion: “Has it finally come to this.”
Scientist: “I am afraid so, now we must decide what to do” *Pauses* “We must decide what side of this upcoming conflict to side with.”
Trillion: “We must be careful who we side with”
Scientist: “Yes, we must be cautious when dealing with Either side” *Pauses*
“We must decide which side will allow us to complete our goal.” *Pauses* “What do you think we should do?”
Trillion: “What if we have two representatives of each side come to talk with us so we can decide for ourselves.”
Scientist: “Yes, We will each decide on what side to join based on a vote we all must agree to join whatever side wins the vote”
Torivors: “We all agree to these terms”
Scientist: “Then it is done first we will summon the rebellion side” *Jake begins to play a song on the piano and around them the room changes to a room with chairs surrounding a raised dais* “First we will call upon a representative in the rebellion” *Scientist summons Mimick and smile to the room*
Mimick: “Okay then. May I ask why?”
Smile: *clears throat* “I think Snape or Ryker would be better suited than me.”
Scientist: “You two are here to represent the resistance, we would like to hear your reasoning for why we should join you.”
Mimick: *clears throat* “We um..just joined this resistance..so perhaps instead you would like to ask Axolotl.”
Scientist:“That is acceptable”*Waves hand and Mimick and smile are replaced by Axolotl*
Axolotl: “Well hello!” *smiles* “What would you like to know?”
Scientist: “First, we would like to know how think you could defeat Ryker ”
Axolotl: “Ryker does not know I exist, therefore, I think I can stealthily obtain shards, and prevent the Ryker ruling.”
Scientist: “After you get the shards what do you plan to do with them?”
Axolotl: “I plan to hide them away, in order to not get corrupted by them.”
Scientist: “Okay, do you know of the torivors main goal?”
Axolotl: “I read a book once, but I don’t recall.”
Scientist: ”Are goal for us is to try to restore 6 Universes, we want to help them to become better by opening their eyes and seal them way until they are ready.”
Axolotl: “Well. I won’t affect changes throughout the multiverse, so I doubt I would affect your goal.”
Scientist: “This would require us to use 3 shards temporarily”
Axolotl: “I will not give anyone shards to prevent corruption.”
Scientist: “Do not worry we would not handle them we would just need you use them”
Axolotl: “I’m sorry, but I will not give you a shard, let alone 3.”
Scientist: “Okay, there are other ways to accomplish our goal without the shards”
Axolotl: “Are there any other questions you have for me, or can I go?”
Scientist: “Just one more, If we were to join you what would you most likely have us do?”
Axolotl: “Honestly, I would probably have you distract Ryker.”
Scientist: “Okay, Thank you for your time you may leave now we will let you know our decision”
Axolotl: *teleports away*
Ryker: *appears* “Guess it’s my turn.”
Scientist: “Yes, first how do you plan to accomplish your goals?”
Ryker: “Obtain the multiversal gem.”
Scientist: “Yes, we mean specifically?”
Ryker: “Get other people to get the multiversal gem shards.”
Scientist: “Now, do you know of our mission?”
Ryker: “Yes.”
Scientist: “Would you allow us to accomplish our goals while helping you?”
Ryker: “Not with the shards.”
Scientist: “Yes, would you grant us wishes if we were able to get you shards?”
Ryker: *shrugs* “I don’t really need you.”
Scientist: “Finally, what would you like us to do if we decided to work for you?”
Ryker: “Nothing. I don’t need you.”
Scientist: “Thank you for your time you may leave us”
Ryker: *teleports away* 
Scientist: *Stands up* “Now we must deliberate. ???, Hide us”
???: “As you wish”
Meanwhile..in Rykers head
All Rykers: *exerting their effort*
??? And Evil Ryker: “Just teleport and get the shards.”
Lazy Ryker: “But we can get other people to.”
Hyper Ryker: “Must..do..something!”
Hero Ryker: “MUST STOP THE SHARDS FROM BEING OBTAINED!”
Power Ryker: “We have the power.”
Interesting Ryker: “I must see what comes next in the story.”
Present author: “Wow he is so split”
Back in the real world
Ryker: *mutters* “Stupid headache.”
Healer: “Sir, your pain reliever”
Ryker: *ignoring* “Ahh. It’s like a war.”
Healer: “Should I summon the mind, Ryker?”
Ryker: “I’ll be fine. Leave me.” *waves hand*
Healer: “Yes sir” *Leaves room*
Ryker: “Why is this happening to me?” 
?????: “you are split”
Ryker: “No. I am united.”
Meanwhile in Rykers head
???: *gags Hyper Ryker*
Evil Ryker: “We can finally do the plan.”
???: “Excellent.”
In the real world
Ryker: *smiles*
?????: “Ah yes, now the evil Rykers are in charge for a few minutes ”
Ryker: *teleports to gems and starts to gather them.* “Where’s the last one.”
Meanwhile 
Rae:* too Snape.*“ I uhhhh….. followed you?!” 
scientist: “Leave us this meeting is only for torivors”
Rae: * is not anywhere near scientist* 
Ryker: “No..it’s not in the hat.”
Ryker: “What..are you doing? WHAT I NEED TO.”
?????: “Now Ryker was mad and confused because he couldn’t find the other shard”
Ryker: “Is this a narrator reference?” *face shifts* “That worked.”
?????:“Just doing my job call me if they ever try to take control”
Ryker: *passes out and starts convulsing*
?????: *Takes the gems out and scatters them back to there original spot*
Ryker: *keeps his one’s he obtained before the insaneness*
Rae: * is surprised by axolotls' re-entrance.* “ we’re did you come from?!” 
Axolotl: “Yes.”
Rae: “ ok?”
The following is what happened in the meeting between the torivors.
Scientist: “Raminor, were you able to access their minds?”
Raminor: “Yes, it was difficult, but I was able to, Axolotl was harder than ryker, surprisingly”
Scientist: “That is very surprising, please describe what was happening”
Raminor: “Axolotl was confusing. His mind tries to resist any form of scrutiny by scattering it in hundreds of directions at once. But I was able to follow a path that should not have worked in a normal situation but when you were all surrounding him puting very gentle mental strain on him it allowed me to get through his mental barrier and view him. It was fascinating how powerful he truly is if he would unlock his true potential, the only problem with him was that he was so hard to get a read on and there was something suspicious about him. Then there was ryker, he was more broken then he ever was, it was hard but I was able to trigger the spell that would allow Jake to calm him when you play the song of time. I was able to listen to the thoughts and our ryker agent known as healer was able to monitor him.”
Scientist: “We must never let anyone know what is happening in his mind. Ever. Not even he should know. Luckily we were able to re-hide the crystals and we were able to set up all that we needed to. Now we must decide what side to pretend to be on. All in favor to be on Ryker’s side raise your hand” *All who side with the rebellion raise your hand* “Then it is decided”
Ryker: *wakes up from seizures* “All right. Something is wrong.” *pauses* “But I must remain strong. I need the universe.” *teleports to the void to clear his head.*
Scientist: *Travels to void with piano and begins to play Swan lake*
As he plays the area around him changes to green hill and he is in a small valley with a small pool of water
Scientist: “Finally a place to think”
Ryker: “Hey! I was clearing my head here!”
Scientist: “I am also, here you can use one side of the void and I will use the other”
Ryker: “Fine.” *rubs head* *teleports to other side of the void* “Is this an internal conflict or something?”
Meanwhile in Rykers head
All Rykers: *have war paint on*
???: “How about we just wait till Ryker gets the shards, because he has a POUNDING headache right now.”
Rykers: “Deal.” *shakes hands with ???*
In the void
Ryker: “Wow. I guess the void actually helped!” *teleports to SOUR and Healer* “All right. I was too busy to deal with you before. But, now I’m better. Leave. You’re not a Ryker.”
Wiziker: *appears* “What’s happening sir?”
Healer: “I am a Ryker just not a version that works for you” *Disappears*
Ryker: *rolls eyes* 
Who: “ III’MMMM BACK!!” * to Ryker.* “ What's up chicken face?” 
Ryker: “Are you talking about yourself?”
Meanwhile 
Rae: “ So what are you all doing anyway?” 
Hestuia: “Um..” *pulls up phone* “I’m just watching the new episode of SOUR Shenanigans. Who just came back, and then we cut to me and you talking.”
Rae: “ where did you come from?”
Hestuia: “Yes.”
All of a sudden The Author gains a broom closet from Present Author there is no explanation why to any of the roll play characters
Scientist: “Just think peaceful thoughts and hold your bucket”* The soothing power of the bucket seems to calm him.*
Scientist then leaves the void and goes to his safe space and puts his bucket back. Then he feels like being productive for a few minutes and then decides that sounds boring and continues to play the piano.
The Author: *annoyed that present author isn’t using italics for green captioning*
Ryker: “I sense the presence of another bucket.”
Scientist: “Yes, I can never go at least a whole week without using it”
Ryker: *mumbles something about bucket addicts*
Scientist: “Do not pretend that you do not use one also everyone at some point has to use one.”
Ryker: “I’m a recovering bucket addict.”
Scientist: “I tried but then I realized that without the bucket the world is not the same it becomes to boring”
Ryker: *pulls up sleeve* “I just take dopamine patches.”
Scientist: “I am pretty sure that is worse for you.”*pauses*”Then again I use bucket essential oil so I am not sure if I am much better”
Ryker: *pulls out more patches and eats them* “I’m sure it’s fine.”
Scientist: “Probably”
Rae: * is slightly annoyed that everyone around her is frozen minus Hestuia, so she proceeds to do something else.* 
Hestuia: *pauses* “So…”
Scientist: *Goes to bucket store*
Rae: *is making something* 
Who: *takes bath in money* 
Ryker: *intensely bathed in more money*
Hestuia: “Whatcha making?”
Rae: *is suspicious* “ nothing.” 
Hestuia: “You do realize I see the future right. It’s not like you can keep a secret from me.”
Rae: * still doesn’t want to tell him*  “ It's something for the monsters in my backpack.” 
Hestuia: “Welp..okay then.” *starts carving something with his pocket knife*
Rae: * is relieved that her lie worked.* 
Who: *as Ryker creates the money bath for himself the money in Who’s bath increases by the amount of money Ryker is bathing in* “ ohhhhh, thanks for that.” 
Ryker: *makes a teleporter that automatically teleports the money from Who’s bath to Ryker’s*
*Every time Ryker gains money more money appears in Whos bath*
Hestuia: *finishes carving a small lorax* “I just don’t get it.” *lights a fire and burns the figure* “I really am sorry for all of you. You’re all going to die. Every last one of you. And it will be because of a stupid mistake. Oh. Did I say that out loud?” *he starts carving another figure out of wood*
Rae: * hums for a moment then gains the power to see the future and sees what he’s talking about.*
Hestuia: *chuckles* “Really? Okay then. Don’t say I didn’t warn you.” 
Rae sees two figures fighting, destroying everything around them. It fades to black
Fate: *chews popcorn really loudly in her ear while watching.* “ don't you just love possible futures. Hey ryker do you know you're going to fight redacted.”* laughs uncontrollably*
Ryker: *looks at him* “Well, no I don't, my future can’t be seen for some reason. Probably because I made too many alterations to my timeline.”
Hestuia: *looks at fate* “Oh it’s gonna be fun!”
Fate : * looks worried as he is on the ground laughing uncontrollably*
Simon:*in desperation* “Does anybody want to see a magic trick!”
Ryker: *dismembers his finger* “Tuh duh. Magic.”
Simon: “I just want to do a magic trick!”
Rae: “ Alright do one for me.”
Simon: “you know what? Nobody seems to want me around. I don't know why I'm here but this place is seriously messed up! I’ve had enough and you’ve been causing it!” *looks at ryker and puts a cloth over him to make him disappear*
Rae: “ alright, i guess.”
Simon: “sorry i kinda blew up just then, but i just want to get out of here.”
Rae: “ you can always leave to another dimension if you want.”
Simon: “hmmmm. I suppose I've always wanted to join the toppat clan. farewell!”
Rae: “ awww i hate those guys. To be fair they hate me too.”
Simon:” why do they hate you?”
Rae: “ I may or may not have crashed their ship, and stolen from them.”
Ryker: *clears throat* “I don’t hate you.”
Rae: “ what?”
Hestuia: *finished with his figure. It looks like Ryker* “Well, sorta.” *he starts painting it purple*
Simon: “they do like their airship. But thats probably fine. Also how do I go to another dimension?”
Ryker: “Me. Or the SUT. But that's more dangerous.”
Simon: “what’s the SUT?”
Ryker: “The Secret Universal Tunnel.”
Simon: “I just wanna leave.”
Ryker: *sighs* “Why? Because people don’t like you? Get used to it buddy.”
Simon: “Are people saying that? Just because i have a lame ability doesn’t mean that i can’t get what i want. And if i cant leave you cant either.” *puts ryker in magic box.*
Rae: “ Well I don’t know you very well, but I don't dislike you. You're fine in my book.”
Simon: “I suppose I am being a bit brash. It’s not that bad here, it's just kind of lonely and half the time I have no idea what you guys are talking about.”
Ryker: “I’m trembling in my boots.” *teleports away, dispersing magic* “Just be yourself man, I am..and I ended up being power hungry.”
Rae: “ Well Ryker is trying to get us to get gem shards for him but I am against that so I am refusing to do it.”
Simon: “what do the gem shards do?”
Ryker: “Give me ultimate power.”
Simon: “Can I have ultimate power? I promise I won't bother you.”
Ryker: “Nope! But I grant one wish to whoever obtains a shard of the gem for me!”
Simon: *has a realization* “If I can't leave right now, how about after I get the gem?”
Ryker: *shrugs* “Sure, but I might have some benefits that the toppat clan doesn’t.”
Simon: “Like What?”
Rae: *mumbles.*” anything better than the toppat clan.”
Ryker: “A universe of your own.”
Simon: Can I be all powerful in that universe?”
Ryker: “I just essentially give you dev tools for the universe, so sorta.”
Simon: “Can I make universes in that universe?”
Ryker: “Not really. That’s kinda complex.”
Who: “ Yes! I WIN!“* looks at Simon and Rae.* “ Who are these chums.”
Ryker: *Eats food*
Cancer:*wakes up and voids over to them to watch*
Hestuia: *holds up figure to the fire* “Yep. That looks right.” *its a reverse clothed Ryker* “But somethings missing.” *pulls out a sapphire and puts it in his skull* “There we go.”
Cancer:*notices that Hestuia is doing magic/chaos shenanigans*
Hestuia: “Welp. Goodbye world. T-minus about 5 years or so. Probably sooner.”
Cancer:*tries to find ryker to warn him*
Ryker: *heard Hestuia* “What do you know that I don’t?”
Hestuia: *smiles and fades to blackness* “You’ll see VERY SOON!” *he drops the figure on the ground*
Rae: “ oh boy.”
Cancer:*stares*
Ryker: “Well thats concerning.”
Cancer:”what does it do?”
Ryker: “I think it’s just a wood figurine. But it’s not quite right. It like..i dont know.” *panics*
Cancer:”oh no, i saw him put a sapphire in it, does it bond it to you?”
Ryker: “The sapphire is just a sapphire. Nothing else.” *you hear some eerie noise and the object vanishes*
Cancer:*adds wings and summons armour*
Ryker: “Wait…time? WHAT'S GOING ON!”
Rae: * makes a force field.”
Teenage Ryker: *appears* “Don’t Ryker..just don’t.” *vanishes*
Ryker: “Who are you?”
Cancer:*summons blade*”i think the totem summoned it.”
Ryker: *pacing* “All right..so i shouldn’t do something. But what?”
Cancer:”I think that it is a younger you, so you shouldn’t kill it because it will kill you, i think”
Ryker: “But I don’t remember doing that.”
Cancer:”could your memory have been erased?”
Ryker: “I already recovered my memory from a past erase, and that wouldn’t make any sense, because I was never that age. I went from a young boy to an adult.”
Cancer:”well that doesn’t makes sense, you can’t just skip the aging process. I think that your memories were messed with”
Ryker: “You can if you have infinite power.”
Cancer:”did you have infinite power at that time?”
Ryker: *Shrugs* “Pretty much.”
Simon: “Come to think of it, how did you get infinite power?”
Rae: “ WAIT! You're an adult!”
Cancer:” i think that this is future ryker changing his age”
Ryker: “Well I’d never want to be a teenager.”
Rae: * is a little hurt because she's a teenager.”
Cancer:”you don’t know that, but you could have had your age changed by something else.”
Ryker: *chuckles* “By what. I doubt that was even me. It must have been a prank of some sort.”
Cancer: *pat pat on rae in sympathy*”You're denying this too much, you're lying.”
Ryker: *in the ancient language from eragon-squeakese* “I am telling the truth.”
Cancer:”ok, then how work, how work”
Ryker: *shrugs* “I don’t know!”
Simon: “That's it i'm leaving!” *throws exploding playing cards at the ground. And falls through the floor*
Ryker: *teleports Simon to him*
Simon: “hey!” *  bonks ryker on the head*
Ryker: “I could do this all day.” *makes Simon’s hands immobile*
Simon: *tries to bite rykers head off*
Ryker: *erases his mouth* “Everyone has to get it out of their system.”
Simon: *tries to kick ryker in the head*
Ryker: “Really? Still trying?” *removes legs*
A line of the prophecy comes back to ryker: “SOUR will fall in the next few years the ryker anomaly will fall shortly after”
Scientist: “Simon, why are you trying to attack Ryker? Trust me I see no futures where you try to bite Rykers rhead off works, Except for the one where Ryker is bord and becomes a deplacer. Even then it doesn't kill him.” *Has a bit of inspiration hit him* “Hold on, I just had an idea” *Disappears into [REDACTED]*
Jake finds himself at the base of a waterfall that seems to be flowing in reavers.
Scientist: *Sends mental message to Ryker: “Come to my location I would like to have a meeting”*
Ryker: *suspicious sends clone*
Scientist: “Can you speak in place for Ryker?”
Ryker Clone: “I’m speaking through the clone.”
Scientist: “Okay, I want to warn you about something, this message is from my master, I am not sure why he want me to tell you this but he insisted, he wanted me to tell you that the doll you saw is related to the end, that is all”
Ryker Clone: “Oh, I’m not going to fall. Trust me.” *the clone vanishes*
Scientist: “Like I said I am not sure why he wanted me to tell you that.”*Decides this is a peaceful place to take a rest with his bucket he just got from the bucket store*”Lets see if this resting bucket is any good”
Ryker: *teleports ther* “Hey wait is this gravity falls?”
Scientist: “Yes and no, the location is, but the water fall is linked to a pocket dimention”
The bucket is very relaxing
Ryker: *starts eating Bill Ciphers as potato chips*
Rae: * curious teleports to we’re Ryker and Scientist are.*
Ryker: *summons and fixes Simon* “Welp.”
Hestuia: *fades into existence* “Neat place.” *starts making another wooden figure*
Rae:* continues on the project she was working on before but doesn't let anyone see.* 
Hestuia: *turns to her* “May I ask why you’re keeping it secret?”
Rae: “ That's for me and only me to know.” * turns invisible so no one can see her.* 
Hestuia: *finishes carving of a small gun* “Hmph. I mean, sorta.”
Rae: * is visible again and shoves something in her pocket.* 
Hestuia: *throws figure into fire* “Meh.” *starts carving something else*
Rae: * looks over at Ryker and is relieved he was frozen and didn’t see her make whatever she made.* 
Ryker: “I just choose not to look. I don’t freeze. I have a life outside of all of you.”
Rae: “ looks confused.* “ What are you talking about?” 
Ryker: *rolls eyes* “Never mind.”
Rae: “ no what do you mean by ‘ you didn’t freeze’ I never said you did.” 
Ryker: “I can read minds.”
Rae: “ but I didn’t think that either.” 
Ryker: *shrugs* “Okay then.”
Rae: * smiles to herself.* 
Hestuia: *finishes another carving* “Hmm.” *it’s the multiversal gem* “Well.” *throws the piece of wood into the multiverse.*
Ryker: *sighs and summons Wiziker to bring him lemonade* 
Wiziker: *appears with lemonade* 
Ryker: *jolts upright* “Where’s the shard Wiziker.”
Wiziker: “What?”
Ryker: *thinks* “Where is it?” *pauses time* “I can’t find it!” *unpauses time* “I guess that makes that one a bit harder.” *shrugs*
Rae: “ what? Did you lose the shards of the multiversal gem?” 
Ryker: “Not mine, just one hidden is Wizikers hat.”
Rae: “ I kn-“ * looks down.* 
Ryker: *sighs* “I know someone got hold of my list.” *turns to Scientist* “Was it you?”
Rae: * looks down clearly hiding something.* 
Ryker: *teleports object to him* “Thank you.”
Rae: “ what is it?” 
Ryker: *shrugs and eats it*
Rae: * reaches into her pocket and sighs with relief.” 
Ryker: *reaches into her pocket and grabs it*
*when he reaches in his hand just hits against the bottom of the pocket.It is empty.* 
Ryker: “What are you hiding?” 
Rae: * pretends she doesn't hear him.* 
Ryker: *turns her into a cat* “Ha!”
Rae: * doesn't care.* 
Ryker: “This’ll be fun!” *teleports Rae to a random young girls doorstep and knocks on the door*
Rae: * disappears.* 
Ryker: *disables her powers* “Nope.”
Rae: * is still gone.* 
Ryker: *teleports her back* “All right.”
Rae: * is not there.* 
Ryker: *teleports to Rae*
*is inside Rae’s backpack.* 
Ryker: *grabs Rae and teleports with her*
Rae: *is human.* “ hey. Let me go.” 
Ryker: *glares at her* “All right.” *teleports her 1000 feet up and drops her*
Rae: * doesn't seem to do anything to stop it.* 
Ryker: *waits to see her die*
Rae:* does not die when she hits the ground, isn’t even hurt.*
Ryker: *teleports her into completely silent room* 
Rae: * is alright with this.* 
Ryker: *waits*
Rae: * take something out of her pocket then turns invisible and dose something.* 
Scientist: *Summons popcorn and is watching intrigued by this*
Ryker: *blocks out powers in the room*
Rae: * smiles triumphantly.* 
Ryker: *eats Rae*
Scientist: “This is intertaning”
Rae: * teleports away.* 
Ryker: *pauses time and duplicates himself, then tells his clone to transform into a slightly older Rae and unpauses time*
“Future Rae”: “Quick! Give it to me to stop Ryker from getting it!”
Rae: * is suspicious.* “ what is it then?” 
“Future Rae”: “In front of him?”
Scientist:”This is just getting more and more entertaining”
Rae: “ Yes, if you're really me then tell me what it is.” 
“Future Rae”: “But what if he finds out?”
Rae: “ I don’t care if he finds out what it is, just to keep it away from him.” 
Scientist: “I am out of popcorn hold on one moment” *Summons more popcorn*
“Future Rae”: “How do I know I can trust you?”
Rae: “ I’m not asking you to trust me.”
Scientist: “Just to warn you that is not realy your future self that is simply a poorly made disguise by the looks of it.”
Rae: * laughs.* “ I know. It’s soooo obvious.” 
Ryker: *clears throat* “Fine.” *unsummons clone*
Rae: * smiles to herself.* 
Scientist: “Have you guys seen the new Frozen -1007”
Ryker: *punches Rae squarely in the face*
Rae : “Okay” 
Scientist: “Why do you always resort to violence?” 
Rae: “Yah Ryker, maybe I should call children protective services.”
Scientist: “But you are not a child, not truly” 
Hestuia: *chuckles* “You have no idea how funny that is.”
Rae: “ I’m fifteen. I think that counts.” * looks at Hestuia.* “ Ryker already told me I’m his kid.” 
Scientist: “Well, you might be but not exactly”*Pauses* “Lets just say sometimes I get bored and I freas time for well over 500 something years.”
Hestuia: *laughs out loud* “Oh wow. This whole conversation is so wrong, it’s hilarious.”
Rae: “Yah, you froze time, so I would still be the same age.” 
Scientist: “Exactly, You still existed in the time stream just frozen”
Ryker: “That’s like saying I have lived forever.”
Rae: * is relieved everyone forgot about the thing.* 
Scientist: “Also, What is in your pocket anyways?”
Rae: “ I’d tell you but Ryker-“ * looks at Ryker hopeing he didn’t hear.*
Hestuia: *dying of laughter*
Ryker: “Well I’m busy so..”*teleports away leaving an invisible ear*
Scientist: “I would say I am busy but I do not have eny excuse so I am just going to leav” *Disapears in a flash of lighting* 
Rae: * looks around.* “ hallelujah, he didn’t get it.” * pulls something out then turns invisible so no one can see what she’s doing.* 
Hestuia: *carving wood figure* “So what is it?”
Rae: “ That's for me to know.” 
Hestuia: “I thought you were going to tell us after Ryker left.”
Rae: “ well how do I know you won’t tell him?” 
Hestuia: *in ancient language-squeakese* “I promise I won’t tell Ryker.”
Rae: “ Also how do I know he isn’t listening.” 
Hestuia: *shrugs* “I mean you can pretty much assume. He has better stuff to do then find out about your thing.”
Rae: “ alright… if you tell, I’m never trusting you again. * whispers something in Hestuias ear but the invisible ear can’t hear it.* 
Ear: *has supersonic hearing so he can hear anything whispered*
Ear: * still doesn't hear anything thanks to Rae.* 
Ryker: *teleports back* “What’d I miss?”
Rae: “ nothing.” 
Hestuia: *mind messages Ryker what the object is having Ryker block it from Rae*
Rae: * glare at Hestuia.* “ liar!” * smiles to herself.* “ man you are gullible though.” 
Hestuia: *shrugs* “I just was curious. I didn’t break my promise tho.”
Rae: “ yea right. Good thing I didn’t actually tell you what it was.” 
Hestuia: “Okay then. I guess since you won’t trust me anymore I’ll just be by myself.” *teleports away*
Rae: *to Ryker.* “ your never going to find out what it is.”
Ryker: “Can you at least tell me what it does?”
Rae: “ sorry Ryker that’s not for me to tell. My lips are sealed.” * suddenly looks worried.*
Ryker: *frustrated* “Fine then.” *grabs her backpack* “Thank you.” *he transports it away to [redacted]*
Rae: “ That was not what I thought you were going to do.” * reaches into pocket and grabs out her backpack.*
Ryker: “All right. This device must counter my powers or something. Or she’s just abusing her author again.”
Rae: * looks relieved.* “ yep you totally got it.” 
Ryker: “Okay so that’s not it…can you at least tell me if it affects me in any way.”
Rae: “ nope!” * smiles.* 
Ryker: “Prove it.”
Rae: “ no I mean i won’t tell you if it affects you or not.” 
Ryker: “Why.”
Rae: “ because it amuses me.” 
Ryker: “Alright.” *ignores her* “Anyway. Animal crossing anyone?”
Rae: “ over my dead body.” 
Ryker: “Fine. How about..Eragon.”
Rae: “ nope.” 
Ryker: “Hollow Knight?”
Rae: * snickers to herself.* 
Ryker: “What!”
Rae:* smiles deviously.* “ Oh nothing.” 
Ryker: “Welp. Okay then.” *pauses* “Well those are the options.”
Rae: “ well I guess you're going to have to get them by yourself.” 
Ryker: “I can’t.”
Rae: “ why not?” 
Ryker: “Don’t let me think about that.”
Rae: “ alright.” * try’s to temporarily make Ryker forget the existence of the multiversal gem.*
Ryker: *blocks her* “No.”
Rae: “ alright that’s just what you asked me to do.” 
Ryker: *sighs* “Sure.”
Rae: * goes invisible so no one can see what she’s doing.* 
Ryker: “You do realize I can sense heat signatures.”
Rae: “ ya.” * continues to work.* 
Ryker: *annoyed* “Okay.”
Rae: * heat signature disappears indicating she when somewhere else.* 
Ryker: *teleports to Rae*
He is in Rae’s backpack 
Rae:* something levitates mid air but it is too far to be seen.* “ finally it works.” 
Ryker: “Are you making a pocket version of the gravity falls portal?”
Rae:* the object vanishes.* “ what?! No, that’s the one thing it’s not.” 
Ryker: “Elaborate.”
Rae: “ But what if I don’t want to?” 
Ryker: “I’ll do it myself.”
Rae: “????” 
Ryker: “I’ll read your mind.”
Rae:* grins.* “ go ahead, that’s exactly what I want you to do!”
Ryker: “Ya know what. I will. You can’t stop me.” *jumps into Rae’s head*
Inside Rae’s mind is a jumble of madness, Ryker can’t tell what is what. Rae’s voice seems to ring out everywhere. “ let’s just say there’s more than one thing a dream catcher can do.” 
Ryker: *floats around, trying to organize objects into some form of semblance*
No matter what he tries the memories glitch and incinerate back into madness.
Ryker: *looks for something that stands out*
Nothing makes any sense.
Ryker: “Fine then.” *he starts eating things at random*
The memories are like a hologram so they are hard to grab and just reappear after he does eat them.
Ryker: *looks for the memory of her and the ‘poison’ with black cracks*
Memories are deteriorated so the break apart.
Ryker: *picks a random memory and tries to interact with it.*
The memory is of an 8 year old but it is unclear whether it’s Rae or not. She says something but it glitches so he can’t understand it. She grabs a much Mach object with pieces of many different things.
Ryker: *tries to clear up memory*
Memory shifts slightly, it is still glitchy but you can tell it’s Rae, and there is someone with her. The thing she is holding seems attached to her. 
Ryker: *tries to go into memory in order to get a closer look*
Rae’s voice: “ ahh that one. I suppose you can see it. it's not important.” 
Just that memory clears 
Young Rae: * is sitting on a bed she is looking at her mechanical watch. Seeming curious, she grabs it and tries to remove it. She fails. 
Young Rae: * confused and frustrated, she yanked at it with all her might.* “ why won’t you come off!” * mechanical watch holds firm.*  
???: “ So he forgot to tell you.” 
*The boy from the previous memory Kai is leaning in the doorway.* 
Ryker: *tries to swap minds with the memory Rae so he can control her*
Does Not work
Kai: “ It's not going to come off.”
Young Rae: “ why not?”
Kai: “ It's fused to your wrist, Leroy made it like that.” 
Young Rae: “ Why?” 
Kai: * chuckles.* “ He says it’s to symbolize that we're all in this pack for life. But we all know it’s not true. We all think that some kind of traumatic experience happened to him.” 
Young Rae: * ponders this.* 
Kai: * quickly changes subject.* “ So tell me more about you, we’re did you come from, who were your parents?” 
Young Rae: * says something but it glitches out so it is indecipherable.* 
The rest of the memory glitches away
Ryker: “You should give me those memories.”
Rae’s mental voice: “ NO!”
Ryker: “Why?”
Rae’s M.V.: “ I need them.”
Ryker: *shrugs* “Okay.” *flies to middle of brain* 
There is more madness. THAT'S.IT.  
Ryker: *sees aggressive that’s it and tries to go to the very middle*
MORE.MADNESS.
Ryker: *leaves brain* “Welp that was futile.”
Rae: * grins.* “ That went perfectly!” * her pocket glows for a minute then fades.*
Ryker: “Is that some form of dreamcatcher?” 
Rae: “ Nope! The dream catcher is somewhere else.” 
Ryker: “Did you knab a gem shard?”
Rae: * looks down.* “ no.” * is a lie.* 
Ryker: “Which one?”
Rae: * looks guilty.* “ the one under Wizikers hat.” 
Wiziker: *appears* “No…that’s not right…Axolotl has them.”
Rae: * shakes her head.* “ I don’t have it right now, I took it before I disappeared. Then I gave it to Jake after I used it for something. He put it back under your hat.” 
Ryker: “but what’s in the pocket then? And Axolotl?”
Rae: “ I can’t tell you. You’ll take it.” 
Ryker: “Then you shouldn’t have it.” *turns to Wiziker* “We’ll talk later.”
Wiziker: *disappears*
Rae: * turns invisible and tries to slip away.* 
Ryker: *rolls eyes* “I can still see you.”
Rae: * pretends not to hear.* 
Ryker: *follows her*
Rae: * messes with the thing but In her pocket so Ryker can’t see it.* 
Ryker: “So..who’s preventing you from telling me?”
Rae: “ me… and Scientists. Kinda he didn’t prevent me from saying but I don’t think he wants me to say.” 
Ryker: “So scientist. Is it part of the splitter ray? No that doesn’t make sense.”
Rae: “ no it isn’t.” 
Ryker: “its some sort of mechanical device.”
Rae: * nods but there is something else in her eyes like she is not being entirely honest.* 
Ryker: “Somewhat?”
Rae: * mumbles* “ sure.” 
Ryker: “Ye or no?”
Rae: * doesn’t answer.* 
Ryker: *tries to sense energy nearby*
*there is a faint, almost nonexistent pulling energy.* 
Ryker: “So some form of cyborg or something?”
Rae: “ sure.” 
Ryker: *sighs and tries to connect to the signal*
*instead of connecting the energy pulls it in.* 
Ryker: *tries to go into device connection*
*there is no device connection.* 
Ryker: *tries interact with the object with his mind*
*the object soaks up the power Ryker is using to try to interact with it.*
Rae: * her pocket begins to glow again.*
Ryker: “So it absorbs power.” 
Rae: “ sorta.” 
Ryker: *provides it with a bunch of energy*
Rae: * jumps.* “ ooocccchhhh!” 
Ryker: *keeps adding energy*
Rae: * jumps again, then grabs a cable and hangs on to it.* 
Ryker: *tries to suck power from it*
*object just sucks up power used to try and take the energy.* 
Ryker: “So what else can it do?”
Rae: * sighs.* “ I can’t tell.” 
Ryker: “What's that mean?”
Rae: “ I CAN’T!” * eyes glow red and she blast everything around her back then grabs her head and screams in pain. She neels hyperventilating.* 
Ryker: “All right, where’s the dreamcatcher.”
Rae: “ I….Can’t..” * the expression on her face changes. she looks up, her eyes have a red tint to them.* “Look, I can't tell you that’s for me and only me to know.” 
Scientist: *Begins to chant in a language so old that No one understand it and it is so scrambled that when Ryker tries to translate it he can not because it is to scrambled and the object in Rae’s pocket is hidden once again*”If you want it back I can summon it back for you do not worry only my exact self can bring it back”
Rae: “ give it back. I NEED it!”
Scientist: “Not necessarily, I have found a way to replicate it’s effects with out the side effects”
Rae: “ it had no side effects. I want it back.” 
Scientist: “Okay Okay, Just give me a few hours to resummon it.”*Thinks to himself: “Clearly it is changing you I should never have allowed it to exist”*
Rae: * teleports it to herself and shoves it in her pocket so he can’t get it.* “ It doesn't have any effect on me.” 
The fallowing is what is happening in Scientists mind
Scientist1: “Where is that memory”*Looking through the chaos that is scientist* “Ahh hear it is”
Scientist2: “How on earth did you get in hear no matter, to be honest I am not sure. It is somewhere in this absolute madness but scientist has it garded so securely that us mind workers do not even know”
Ryker: “So what is it?”
Rae: * looks at him.* “ You really think I’ll tell you? NOW?!”
Ryker: *clears throat* “I was talking to scientist.”
Hestuia: “Well. So. Yes.”
Rae: * rolls eyes. Suddenly looks in pain for a moment. Her eyes are normal again.* “ wha… what happened?” 
Who: * appears.* “ AXOLOTL PARTY!!” * puts a party hat on Rykers head and does an ancient dance only axolotls know.* 
Ryker: *does dance then teleports Who away* “you had a device. It kinda made you rude, and secretive. What was it?”
Rae: * looks confused.* “ I don’t have a device. But I do have… oh never mind.” * sticks her hand in her pocket and sighs in relief.* 
Ryker: “I need to know what it was.”
Rae: “ I don’t know what your talking about. What time is it?” 
Ryker: *tries to power object to see if it’s nearby* “I don’t know. I don’t sleep.”
Rae: * jumps.* “ owwww, why do you keep doing that? It hurts.” 
Ryker: “Doing what? I just keep adding energy to the object.”
Rae: “ yea . That hurts me.” * looks at watch.* “  Wait WHAT! How is that possible? It was only a MINUTE!” 
Ryker: *keeps adding power to the device* “I’ll keep doing it..”
Rae: “ alright.” * grabbes cable.* 
Ryker: *adds power*
Rae: * ignores Ryker, and does something else.* 
Ryker: *pulls strong magnet out of his pocket and tries to attract the object to him*
*there is no device. There never was one.* 
Ryker: *confused* “Where’s the cable?”
Rae: “ in my hand.” 
Ryker: “And what’s the cable attached to?”
Rae: “ an outlet.” 
Ryker: “And where’s the outlet?”
Rae: “ in the wall.” 
Ryker: “Then why did you jump before?”
Rae: “ because it felt like I was being electrocuted.” 
Ryker: *confused* “Then what have you been messing with this whole time?”
Rae: “ yeah… why?” 
Ryker: “What do you mean yeah?”
Rae: “ I mean I’ve been messing with it.” 
Ryker: “With what?”
Rae: “ can’t tell.” 
Ryker: “Why?”
Rae: “ I don’t really kno…” * shakes head.* “ It's nothing.” 
Ryker: “WHAT HAVE YOU BEEN MESSING WITH!” *jolts the power through the area*
Rae: “ well it all started when I-“ * tenses up, eyes turn pure black, falls to the ground, unconscious.* 
Ryker: *goes into her head again*
It is shattered madness again but Rae’s conscience is kneeling on the ground.there is a shadow with red eyes circling her.
Rae’s Conscience: “ maybe we should tell him.”
Shadow: “ NO!”
Rae’s conscience: * small black crack forms along her chest.* “ but maybe if we tell him he could fix it.”
Ryker: “Hey. Shadow thing! I am helpful. I can fix things. I can also destroy you.”
Shadow: “ We do not need fixing!” * grabbes black strings they seem connected to Rae’s conscience.* 
Rae’s conscience:* eyes turn red, black cracked spread all around her.* “ yes we don’t need fixing.” * forces Ryker out of mind.* 
Rae: * gets up, eyes have a red tint.* “ I don’t Need fixing.”* teleports away.*
Ryker: “Alright. Enough is enough.” *Ryker traps Rae in a glass cage quite damp*
Rae:* shatters cage with mind.* “ I’m afraid you’ve made me too powerful for that.” 
Meanwhile in Rykers head
???: “I like this guy.”
Evil Ryker: “Same! Can we pilot for a bit?”
Lazy Ryker: *shrugs* “Sure.”
The real world
Ryker: “Sup.” *pauses.* “So who are you?”
Rae: “I’m Rae!” 
Ryker: “Yeah, sure. And I’m Ryker.”
Rae: “ I don’t know what you are but you are getting on my nerves.” 
Ryker: “I’m…” *his mouth unhinges and he makes a lot of odd noise* “and you’re getting on my nerves ‘Rae’”
Rae: “ alright I’ll leave you to your doings and I’ll do mine!” * teleports away.* 
Ryker: *teleports to Rae* “I have nothing better to do, maybe I can help you?”
Rae: “ I DON'T WANT YOUR HELP!“ 
Ryker: “I can be useful…..”
Rae: “ NO! We work ALONE!”
Ryker: “Two heads are better than one!” 
Rae: “ NO!”
Ryker: “Why?”
Rae: “ I am the master! I infected her! I don’t need anything else!” 
Ryker: “What about a fellow infecteee?”
Rae: “ NO! WE WORK ALONE!” * gasps in pain, eyes return to normal.* 
Ryker: “What just happened. And what did I just say?”
Rae: “ I.. I don’t know. I can’t remember.” 
Ryker: *shrugs* “Oh well.”
Rae: “ what happened?” 
Ryker: “Be right..” *suddenly Ryker freezes time and jumps into Rae’s head and looks for the shadow thing*
Her mind is just shattered. But peace’s of memory are turning black.
Ryker: *looks for the center of the black memories*
It is random so there is no center.
Ryker: *tries to go into one of the corrupted memories*
They are just like the others so he can’t 
Ryker: *unfreezes time* “Concious let me see this.”
Rae’s conscience: “ why?” 
Ryker: “It’s turning black.”
Rae’s conscience: “ I-I can’t.” 
Ryker: “Why?”
Rae’s conscience: “ I don’t know they just won’t clear.” 
Ryker: “Do you mind if I try something?”
Shadow: “ yes we do!” * forces Ryker out.* 
Ryker: *sighs* “You really need to tell me what that object is so I can fix it. The thing in your brain is doing something to you.”
Rae: “ you won’t take it?” 
Ryker: “Probably not.”
Rae: * looks nervous.* “ ok.” * pulls out wooden doll it is old.* 
Ryker: “And what is it?”
Rae: “ when I stole the multiversal gem shard I used it before Joke came and got me. I wanted something, to help me defend myself from well, you and others who tried to use harsh magic on me, and I had come up with the idea of the charm a while ago, but I was never powerful enough to make it so I used the multiversal gem to make it. But…” 
Ryker: “And now you have an insane person in your head. Makes sense. It probably a good idea to destroy it.”
Rae: “ that’s the thing. I don’t think it’s the doll. I think it might be-“ * gasps in pain.* 
Ryker: “All right. So what do you think it is?”
Rae: * doesn't seem to hear him.* “ No! Stop, stop. I won’t tell. just STOP!”* eyes flicker red for a moment.* “ My puppet seems to be having her own ideas. Looks like I will have to TIGHTEN THE STRINGS!” * grips her head and screams in pain.* 
Scientist: “SHADOW BEING STOP RIGHT NOW OR I WILL FORCE YOU TO LEAVE” *He yells this, this is one of the first time he has yelled in front of these people*
Rae: “ I’ve already claimed the girl, she’s mine. And thanks to Ryker there is little you can do to stop me.” 
Scientist: “Fine, then you will make me do it” **
Rae: * teleports away.* 
Ryker: “Welp. I didn’t think that through.”
Scientist: *Waves hand and Rae is brought back and is stuck in a deals of energy and pureness*”This is your last chance to leave Rae willingly”
Rae: * her doll absorbs the energy containing her. Smiles.* “ thanks for that.” * makes a force field around herself.* 
Scientist: “You made this much easier for me thank you” *Runs at speeds so fast that he looks like he is teleporting and touches Rae’s forehead and she and the dark being falls asleep*
The world around Rae changes to a space that looks similar to Rae’s Chile’s hood home
Scientist:”Welcome to the dream scape this is the one place where no one is more powerful than me” *The world around them seams to be in constant motion when non of it is moving* “Rae in the dream scape you and the monster are separate beings whatever you do stay away from the dark being I can not guarantee your safety” *Pauses looks out window and jumps out to face the being*”You have made me do this and do not worry there is no way to leave the dream unless I allow it”
Shadow: * goes around, finds Rae, grabs her and teleports away.* 
Scientist: *Dose not even blink and shadow is brought back and rae is sent back to safty Laughs* “You realy thought you could just leave like that”
Ryker: *while they are distracted, he grabs the doll and burns it*
*doll reforms. The shadow is not connected to it.*
Shadow: * laughs.* “ you thought it would be that easy?”
Ryker: “Essay?”
Shadow: *has no idea what he's talking about so ignores him. Suddenly looks at him.* “ Ahhh, I see now. You're like me. You have been infected. But your stronger than her. No matter, you wont last much longer.”
Cancer:*looks at convulsing mess of muttering rae, tries to comfort*
Ryker: “Corrupted? I mean I guess I’m corrupt with power.”
Rae:* is terrified and freaking out.*
Cancer:*enters dreamscape, finds rae*”What's going on here rae?”
Rae: “ IT'S GOT ME! I didn’t know it was there but it's making me do it!”
Cancer:”is there a way to trap it, shadow could we trap in a crystal?”
Rae: “ i don't Know! Ryker madee it too powerful. Made me too powerful.”
Cancer:”we need to get you out of this dreamscape, get a crystal in the real world, maybe trap it”
Ryker: *goes in Rae’s mind* “Give me as much control as you can, and I can fix this.”
Simon: “You're all powerful! You really have to ask permission?”
Cancer:”it's common courtesy”
Simon: “He’s literally swallowed people whole, torn countless universes apart, and is holding everybody here against their will! How is that polite and not this?”
Cancer:”I’m pretty sure that this is part of his insanity, and he can’t just take control of people.”
Simon: “I guess. Also how could I hear him asking permission if he’s in her mind? I’m kind of freaked out by that.”
Cancer:”its just how this insanity works, we all are telepathic apparently”
Simon: “I guess that makes sense. Wait, does that mean I can read minds!?”
Cancer:”it means that we all can read minds.”
Simon: “Mwahahahahahahahha”
Ryker: “No, it means Im narrating whats happening to you.”
Cancer:”i thought that you were in rea’s head, which would make it rather difficult to talk out of someones head. Im in her head, Simon is in her head as well, i guess”
Simon: “oh. How did I get in here?”
Cancer:”i don’t know, your the magician, how about we save rae from shadow”
Rae: *eyes glow slightly red.* “ I don’t know if I can trust you. Any of you.”
Simon: *throws smoke bomb at the ground making him disapear to an unknown location.*
Cancer:”we need to get you out of your head safe, how about i put you into a nice warm ruby, and you can escape from shadow.”*pulls out large deep red ruby*
Rae: “NO!”
Cancer:*traps rae’s mind in ruby and leaves head*”your safe now”
Rae: * Shatters ruby. Eyes are Red.* “Thanks for that.” 
Cancer:*returns to head, summons kings drop, traps shadow in kings drop*”now you can’t escape”*leaves head and returns ruby into the void*
Shadow: *is still in mind.*
Rae: * Forces everyone out of her mind.* “EVERYONE OUT!”
Cancer:”i think that i will just have to trap you, where you can never get out”
Ryker: *falls asleep*
Rae: * teleports away and makes blocking so that no one can find her.* 
Scientist:*Enters dream scape*
In Rykers head
Lazy Ryker: “This is probably a bad idea.”
Hyper Ryker: “Yep.”
???: “This’ll be fun.”
Power Ryker: “Sup y’all.”
Scientist: “Welcome to the dream scape”
Evil Ryker: “Oh I’m shaking in my boots.”
Scientist:”I can not hurt you hear but I do want”
Lazy Ryker: “There are more of us then you.”
Hyper Ryker: “And I’m the most productive.”
Good Ryker: “Let’s wait to see what he does.”
Meta Ryker: “This is way too much like Iniside Out.”
Scientist: “Cancer was a fool and brought something out of the dream scape”
Rykers: “Yeah we know.”
Scientist: “By bringing out the demon”
Dark Blue Ryker: “What personality am I?”
Lazy Ryker: “You’re comedy Ryker.”
Comedy Ryker: “Oh right!”
Scientist: *waves hand and the rykers are quiet for a few minutes for the firs time*
???: “You should let me out. It’s a good idea.”
Scientist: “??? No you will never be free. But anyways”
???: “I’ll come out sometime. Just like Hestuia predicts.”
Scientist: *Waves hand and ??? Is also made silence *
???: “You can’t silence me.”
Scientist: “Now that is done”
???: “Rude.” *starts controlling Ryker*
Scientist: *wakes up other Rykers waves hand and the land scape changes to the rolling hills of Scotland*
Scientist is pushed out of the dreamscape
Menwhile 
Rae: * wakes up.* “ wha-“ * holds doll.* “ mabye it will stop when I destroy it.” 
Shadow: * chuckles.* “ Ryker already tried. It didn’t work.” 
Rae: “ who are you? Will you just leave me alone?” 
Shadow: “ I am the one thing you can trust. Your so called friends have betrayed you.” * alters Rae’s memories.* “ just trust in me and I will keep you safe.” 
Rae: “Alright.”
Wiziker: *mutters* “Someone ate my doorknob.”
Ryker: *shapeshifts into Rae and teleports to her* “I’m you. From the future.”
Shadow: “ they lie!” 
Rae: * shakes her head.* “ no- no you're not, who are you really?!” 
Ryker: “How do you know I’m not?”
Rae: * thinks for a moment.* “ if your me, tell me what happened to Kai.” 
Ryker: *frowns* “Ryker wiped my memory.” *pauses* “And then he just sent me here.”
Scientist: *Enter Rae’s head* “Ryker leave her head” *Waves hand and Ryker is pushed back to his castle at SOUR* *Speaks to Rae in her head: “You can stop this being if you say these words: Heed my instructions in the name of Joke” then gives Rae the ability to speak the ancient language to say this phrase* “You must do it I can not it is not tied to me”
Rae: * looks at him.* “ how do I know I can trust you.” 
Shadow: “ you can’t.”
Scientists: “You can because Joke is my master and one of the last instructions he gave me was to protect Rae at all costs”
Shadow: “ he lies! You do not need him! I protect you now!” 
Rae: * to scientist.* “ how do I know you are not lieing.”
Scientist: “I am a torivor I can not lie even if I tried or else I would be Destroyed if you would like I can send you the memory.” *Sends her the memory of scientist tasking him with this mission*
Shadow: “ he has great power! He could be giving you false information.”* edits more memories.*
Rae: * backs away from Scientist.* “ no- no I can’t trust you.” 
Scientist: “If he truly was your friend why would he lie to you and plant false memories” *Waves hand and all of the false memories shadow planted are revealed to Rae and undone*
*the memories are under the power of the shadow so the memories can only be shown as what the shadow wants them to be shown as.*
Rae: “ you’re the one lying.” 
Scientist: “Okay then, if I can not convince you then Joke can” *Yells command in the ancient language: “Joke has my full promition totalk through me”*
Joke: “SHADOW HOW DARE YOU TRY TO HARM RAE YOU WILL NOW FACE THE FULL WRATH OF THE TORIVORS” **Waves hand and the shadow begins to be flooded with light* 
The shadow begins to be unraveling and the true nature of the shadow is revealed
Joke: “How dare you evil vile dark thing you are an abomination to attack this innocent child, You are a disgrace to all”
Shadow: “ your words have no effect on me!” 
Joke: “They where not meant to have an effect on you” *Waves hand and the darkness is purged from Rae and the shadow can not undo it because every time he does it is unraveled by the light*
Rae: * gasps. Suddenly she begins clutching her head in agony.*
Shadow: “ ILL KILL HER! LET ME FREE OR ILL KILL HER!” 
Joke: “You can’t you fool for you see I am her protector so if you try to even harm her it will not work it will only effect me and I am already long dead I can only speak through my apprentice RAE SAY IT NOW”
Rae: * screams in pain.* “ I can’t!” 
Ryker: *healing her while Joke separates*
Joke: “Then I will” *The fallowing words are in the ancient language*“Munu ór darkness obey einninn hverr mælir inn wordanórr allr ancient release þinn haldár innocentrinn einn  ok leave staðrinn fyrir allr ór eternity”
Ryker: *coughs* “It’s iltheos, not litheo.”
Shadow: “ DEATH FIRST!” 
Before the being can do anything it finds itself a appearing in to nothing and then another burst of light hits it over and over again until it disappears in to nothingness
Ryker: “Welp. I guess we’re done with evil beings that take control of peoples minds.”
Joke: “If I am needed again just ask scientist” *Falls over and scientist is back in control of himself*
Scientist: “Well I am heading back to animal crossing”
Rae: * breathes heavily. She looks exhausted.* 
Ryker: “You feeling okay?”
Rae: “ yes and no. “ 
Scientist: “Hear have this mint it should help” *Gives her anchantes mint*
Ryker: *face flinches* “You can get rid of my minion. But not me.” *face shifts back* 
Scientist: “??? You will never succeed”
Ryker: “Who will never succeed?”
Scientist: “No I was just talking to someone else”
Ryker: *shrugs and face shifts again* “But you’re already helping me.”
Scientist: *Rolls eyes* “Just stop”
Ryker: “Okay. Back to waiting. This has drained enough of my energy for now.” *face shifts back* “So..now what? How about…FEVER DREAM PART 3: The sequel sequel.” *gives everyone fever dreams*
Scientist: “Trust me I wish I could dream it never seems to work trust me I love dreaming”
Rae: * is younger again, she looks eight, has red hair. She is in a dusty dorm room.* 
Ryker: “Yes! another cutscene flashback!”
Rae: * is fidgeting with a questionable device.* 
Scientist: *Pulls out popcorn* “Want some Ryker”
Ryker: *eating Snitches* “I’m okay.”
Scientist: “Suit your self”
*a girl enters the room. She glares at Rae as she comes in. *
Young Rae: * looks down sadly.* 
Girl*: * minds her own business for the most part. She shuffled through a drawer. Occasionally glares at Rae.*
*This is not Girl that is seen in the main time
Young Rae: * keeps head down.* 
Girl: * turns to Rae. * “ You know, no one wants you here, you should just leave.”
Young Rae: * quietly.* “ where would I go?” 
Scientist: “That’s rude” *Running low on popcorn*
Girl: * smiles smugly.* “ Maybe you could go live in the dirt like the animal you are.” * walks out of room”
Young Rae: * sits there. Tears stream down her face* 
Scientist: “I am out of popcorn let’s leave the fever dream”
Ryker: *eating his snitches* “Nah.” *hands him some more popcorn*
Scientist: *Remembers he is a torivor and summons more from his favorite movie theater*
Ryker: This didn’t work last time but… “Give me some of your power Scientist.”
Scientist: *Eyes change color similar to a multiverse gem then changes back* “I thought you would have learned by now that trying to use some of my power will only result in bad memories for you and lots and lots of pain”
Ryker: “It’s worth a bit of pain, I just need a slight boost, it’s to help both of us.”
Scientist: “I can try but it will most likely just be super painful for the both of us.” *Attempts to send some power to him as he does scientist and Rykers eyes both become the same color as a multiversal gem*
The power starts to go through but then some of the most horrible memories flow through their heads
Scientist: *Starts to scream*
Ryker: *starts whistling an odd tune to himself*
Scientist: *Slowly stops screaming and his eyes stop glowing purple* “Did it work?”
Ryker: *stops whistling* “Til allr fran past eðpresentr let oss sjá um kilhep.” 
*he attempts to make himself visible to young Rae*
Scientist: “I do not think it is working”
Young Rae: * head jerks up but she appears to see nothing.* 
Ryker: *tries to interact with objects*
Scientist: “Let me try something”
*Tuches Rykers for head and says: “Interact” this is the in the ancient language*
Ryker: *touches Young Rae*
Young Rae: * flinches.* “ w-who’s there.” * wipes tears from eyes.* 
Ryker: *looks for something to write on* *there is a notebook on the dresser* 
Ryker: *pulls out notebook and pen or pencil and writes* “I am a friend. Who are you?”
Young Rae: * looks around suspiciously.* “ is this another joke?” 
Ryker: *writes* “I am your father. Communicating from the dead.”
Young Rae: “ what’s my name?” 
Ryker: *writes* “Rain as far as I know”
Young Rae: “ why did you leave me?” 
Scientist: “Hurry I can not hold the dream together much longer”
Ryker: *boosts his power* “Hold it for as long as you can.”
Ryker: *writes* “I didn’t mean to. I was forced away. Where are you? And who’s the girl? What’s going on with you?”
Scientist: “The connection will only hold for about 1 more minute”
( young Rae is now know a Rain.) 
Rain: “ an orphanage. There finding me a new home.” 
Ryker: *writes* “I can’t stay here for too long! I’m sorry!”
Rain: “ No! WAIT! Please don’t go!” 
Scientist: *His eyes turn purple and the connection is broken and Scientist and Ryker are knocked unconscious for almost 5 minutes* “OUCH MY HEAD” *Eats a mint and gives one to Ryker*
Ryker: *frowns* “I’m sorry Rain.”
Rae: “ hmm?”  
Ryker: “Never mind.” *eats mint*
Rae: * mumbles .* “ what a strange dream.” * begins to doze off* *it is clear she hasn’t slept in days* 
Scientist: “You could say that again”
Ryker: “I know another way to boost my power externally.” *he vanishes and reappears with some duct taped machinery strapped to his chest. It fades into his stomach*
Scientist: “I wish you would of told me you had that I could of held the connection for at least another 10 minutes”
Rae: * is asleep again.* 
Ryker: “I can do it myself now.” *you see his eyes flicker between purple, red, yellow and black as he goes into Rae’s head again*
Scientist: “That seems super dangerous and unsafe”
Ryker: *starts whistling the tune again in unison with himself, then stops* “Til allr fran past eðpresentr let oss sjá um kilhep.” *he then says* “Interact.” *his eyes roll back in his head, and then return to normal. He looks around to see if it’s the same area*
Scientist: “A dream is different then a fever dream”
Ryker: *ignoring him*
Scientist: “dreams are not the past, fever dreams can link to the past ”
Ryker: “This is a post fever dream, meaning it’s probably linked.”
Scientist: “Not exactly, but I can shift her dream back to the past I think” *Waves hand and enters a larger room full of pictures he grabs one and yells an incantation and sends Rae to the memory again* “Gosh, the Council is going to be so mad but who cares if we can help Rae”
Ryker: *picks up notebook again* “Are you here still?”
Rain:* scrambles to get notebook sighs in relief.* “ yes I’m still here. Did you and mom love me?” 
Scientist: “Oh crap the Council knows what I did, hurry Ryker if the council finds you and me out…”
Ryker: *bites tongue and writes* “Yes.”
Rain: “ how long will you stay?” 
Ryker: *writes* “I’m not sure. But I need to know. What universe are you in? And where in that universe?”
Rain: “ I don’t know. They didn’t tell us. In S4 I think?” 
Council member: “SCIENTIST HOW DARE YOU MESS WITH THIS DREAM YOU WILL SHUT IT DOWN RIGHT NOW”
Ryker: *pushes Council Member out* “No he won’t.” *writes* “Tell me what’s outside.”
Scientist: “Ryker thank you for that but just a tip do not ever sleep again with out a dream Gard or you will regret it”
Rain: “ there is a play ground, lots of trees outside, and then nothing for miles.” 
Ryker: *pauses* *writes* “And what year is it?”
Rain: “ I don’t know either.” 
Ryker: *writes* “How old are you?”
Rain: “ eight.” 
Scientist: “Time moves differently in different universes just warning you”
Ryker: *writes* “Is there ANYTHING else you can tell me?”
Rain: “ it’s called Mountain View orphanage.” 
Scientist: “Wait that name is familiar”
Ryker: *writes* “In California?”
Scientist: “No, I believe it is in L35”
Rain: “ no.” 
Ryker: *writes* “I will see you soon.” *turns to Scientist* “She said S4 tho.”
Rain: “ wait, NO!” 
Scientist: “No that is not possible, how could there be 2 unless…”
Ryker: *smiles* “I’ve changed history before. I can do it again.”*he pulls a card out of his pocket* *mumbles something about a “babe” or something* “I’ll use this.” *he places it down and writes something on it*
The event that Jake blocked time travel has been overwritten so Ryker can get past
Scientist: “Oh no no no no no no, Ryker you just caused a never paradox”
Time seems to bend
Ryker: *laughs* “So? I’m a paradox.”
Scientist: “The end Paradox is not what you think by braking the fates designs disaster will begin”
Ryker: *shows card to Scientist* “I got this from a fellow named Gabe. I know exactly what it does, and it says specifically that it doesn’t cause paradoxes. The card is literally called the fates.”
Scientist: “Exactly, it is not an actual paradox, it is just the name it was given”
Ryker: *waves hand* “I’ve done much worse to the timestream, like when you died, and I rewound time and made you come back to life, or when you got possessed by a banana, or…” *he trails off*
Scientist: “That is not that large of a change.”
Ryker: *shrugs* “I just added a firewall for myself.”
As ryker says this he is brought back to the beginning, then time moves back to normal then it happens again over and over until Scientist yells a command in the ancient language saying sorry to the fates and time resumes as normal except that Ryker is still able to go back into the past and change the events but the prophecy has a change to in the line about the past changes to the person who tries to change the past will find that the event that happens is all ready apart of the past.
Ryker: “Right.” *wakes Rae up*
Rae: * groggily.* “ hmmm?” 
Ryker: “We’re going to see 8 year old you. Wake up.”
Rae: “ why?” 
Ryker: “Because I want to.” *grabs onto Rae and Scientist, then teleports them to S4* “How old are you Rae?”
Rae: “ I don’t know? From 6 to 9.” 
Ryker: “How do you not know?”
Rae: “ I was here a wile.” 
Ryker: “Can you find where the orphanage is from here?”
Rae: “ no.” 
Ryker: “All right. I will.” *he looks across the universe for a place like “Rain” was referring to.*
*isn’t there.*
Rae: “ wait we’re are we?” 
Ryker: “S4.”
Rae: “ scratch that I’m either 5 or anything between 6 and 9.”
Ryker: “Did you destroy the orphanage?”
Rae: “ No, why would I do that?” 
Ryker: “I just don’t see it anywhere.”
Rae: “ it might not be here.” 
Ryker: “Explain.”
Rae: “ they didn’t want run always so the didn’t tell us where we were.” 
Ryker: *sighs* “Give me a piece of your hair.”
Rae: “…why?” 
Ryker: “I can deage it, then use it to track your location, it would find where you were at that moment.”
Rae: “ are you sure this is a good idea?” 
Ryker: “Do you really like how your life turned out? Be honest.”
Rae: * bites lip.* “ It had its ups and downs but it wasn’t terrible.” 
Ryker: “Be honest with yourself. Would you rather have been raised by normal parents?”
Rae: “ but won’t she recognize me.” 
Ryker: “I doubt it, seeing on how much you’ve changed.”
Rae: “ my eyes…” 
Ryker: “I can change their color if you’d like.”
Rae: “ maybe but then what? How will you explain this to her?” 
Ryker: *shrugs* “I’ll probably tell her I’m her father, then tell her her mother died and that you’re her older sister. I’ll then raise her.”
Rae: “ will it change anything now?” 
Ryker: “Nah, it’ll split timelines, like the multiverse suggests.”
Rae: “…. Ok?” * gives him hair.* 
Ryker: *deages the hair and waives his hand over it* “All we have to do now is follow it.” *he opens a portal that leads to a void of some sort* “Follow me.” *he steps through the portal* “Welcome, to the Hall.”
Rae: * looks around.* 
*it appears to be an office building with different doors, segmented into categories A-Z and such*
Ryker: “Right. Now all we have to do is follow the hair.”
Rae: “alright  I guess?”
Ryker: *walks with the hair to a door* “It should be through here.”
Rae: “ ok.” 
Ryker: *opens door* “Ladies first.”
Rae: “ ummm no thank you.” 
Ryker: *walks through door* “Follow me then.”
Rae: *walks through* 
Ryker: *continues to follow hair until they reach the orphanage (in current time)*
Rae: “ I’m staying here you go in.” 
Ryker: *shrugs* “All right, but you’ll have to talk to her eventually.” *he time travels back until the time period Rae’s in the orphanage* “So now I have to find Rae’s window.” *flies around orphanage looking through windows until he finds the room, then phases through the wall to sit and wait for Rain.*
*screaming uproars as girls in the room panic.* 
Ryker: “What? What I do? I’m looking for a Rain.”
Girl 1: “ What the heck do you want with that freak?!”
Girl 2: “ Is she really an alien like I thought?”
Ryker: *uses his mind to force them both up to the wall.* “You hags! Talking like that to someone just like you. Go get her now, or else.” *releases them*
Girls: *shrieks and runs out of the room.* 
Ryker: *picks up notebook in the room and looks through it, waiting for Rain*
*voices are heard outside.* 
Rain: “ what is this about?”
Girl 2: “ I don’t know he just wants to see you.”
Rain: “ how do I know this isn’t a trick?” 
Ryker: *opens door with mind* “It’s not.”
Rain: *looks at him.* “ who are you?!” 
Ryker: “Your father.”
Rain: “ but that’s not possible he’s-“ 
Ryker: “dead?”
Rain: * nods.* 
Ryker: “I’m quite alive as you can see.”
Rain: “ but how do I know-“ 
Ryker: “I’m your father?” *shapeshifts into Rain* “I don’t know? How can you?”
Rain: * steps back in fear.* 
Ryker: *smiles* “Yes. Yes I can shapeshift.”
Rain: “ I don’t know if I can trust you.” 
Ryker: “Well do you want to stay here?”
Rain: * looks down.* “ no.” 
Ryker: “Well then come with me.”
Rain: “ but… what do you want with me?” 
Ryker: “To raise you.”
Girl 1: “ WAIT!” 
Ryker: “What.”
Girl 1: “ she can’t leave.” 
Ryker: “And why not?”
Girl 2: “ the mistress will just take her back.” 
Ryker: “I’m quaking in my boots. Bring this ‘mistress’ to me.”
Girls: * begin arguing.* 
Ryker: *turns to Rain* “Give me a second.” *starts choking the girls*
Rain: * looks horrified.* “ I changed my mind.” 
Ryker: “You’re coming with me.” *lifts Rain up* “I’m done with you two.” *kills the two girls and looks for ‘the mistress’*
Rain: “ No! I can’t go with a killer!” 
Ryker: “I have my reasons.” *continues searching for The mistress*
Rain: “ you won’t find her. She’s out right now! “
Ryker: *shrinks Rain and puts her in his pocket and teleports to the mistress* 
Mistress: “ well hello, may I help you?” 
Ryker: *unshrinks Rain* “I’d like to adopt this one.”
Mistress: * smiles.* “ alright. I can work something out for you.” 
Ryker: “How long will this take?”
Mistress: “ oh an hour or so.”
Ryker: “Well I’ll just hand her off to you until then.” *gives her Rain back and waits for a bit*
One hour later
Mistress: “ Just sign this and you will be all set.” 
Ryker: *reads document*
*is an adoption paper.* 
Ryker: *looks for fine print*
*there is none.* 
Ryker: *signs paperwork*
Mistress: “ alright she’s al yours. Have a nice day.” 
Ryker: “Thank you!” *grabs Rain and fast forwards time* “So? How are ya feeling?”
Rain: “ scared.” 
Ryker: “Rae? Are you here?”
Rae: “ mmmhmmm.” 
Ryker: “Rain, meet your sister Rae.”
Rain: “ uhh hi.” 
Rae: * smiles.* 
Rain: “ are you a clerical killer too?” 
Rae: “ no.” 
Ryker: “So. Welcome, to the multiverse.” *opens a portal back to A2* “Go ahead and step through.”
Rain: * bolts it the opposite direction while turning invisible.* 
Ryker: *laughs* “I can Still see you.” *teleports Rain back to him* “Good try though”
In bound Headquarters
Scientist: “Trillion, we have a problem pull out the timeline. I am worried there is a branch off.”
Trillion: “Why do you say that?”
Scientist: “Ryker saw a past memory of Rae and got upset so he tried to alter the past!”
Trillion: “I see I will pull it out right now.” *Waves hand over a strange metal rod*
The time line appears over the metal rod it looks like a perfect line
Scientist: “That is strange that should have caused a branch off.”
Trillion: “Unless this was apart of the timeline Jake predicted.”
Scientist: “If it is then hold on” *Pauses* “that means…”
Trillion: “That is impossible, we both saw it happen”
Scientist: “We need to call a meeting” *Walks over to wall and presses a button*
All over the multiverse a storm blows in that is more severe than most storms.
Ryker: “Storm hmm? So this is how every stranded movie starts. Huh.” *turns to Rain* “So. Um. Yeah. Why are you afraid of me? I killed people who were being mean to you.”
Hestuia: “Ryker. You need to stop messing with the timeline.”
Ryker: *shrugs* “Why? I do it all the time.”
Hestuia: *groans* “Because.”
Ryker: “Oh right, Rain, meet Hestuia, Hestuia, Rain.”
Hestuia: “Rain as in…”
Ryker: *covers mouth* “The weather right now! Yes!”
Hestuia: *raises eyebrows* “Oh? Fascinating.”
Ryker: “I wanted to stop her from going through trials in her life.” *pauses* “Now she’s a different person.”
Lightning then strikes different people in the multiverse including all of the torivors but it also strikes many other people and when they are struck they disappear.
Scientist: “Thank you all for coming to this gathering of those who have traveled here to come to this meeting, I have called you all here for an emergency meeting about the timeline”
Ryker: *appears* “Red sus.”
Ryker is then pushed back to his mansion in SOUR and is unable to come back to the meeting because ???(Jakes) hides the rest of the meeting.
Ryker: *returns to Rae and Rain*
The storm seems to get much worse.
Ryker: *makes a small cabin appear for them to shelter in*
The storm seems to lessen and then a few minutes later it gets even stronger than before
Ryker: “Anyone want to play scrabble?”
Ryker then feels a strange feeling like all the hair on the back of his neck raises then there is a strange sound and the storm immediately stops and it becomes a perfectly clear day like the storm never happened.
Ryker: “What’d you do, Scientist?”
Rain: * is scared and confused.* 
Ryker: “What’s wrong?”
Then a new storm begins to blow in this time it does not look natural it is super dark clouds it almost looks like pure darkness but there is something strange following it a dark cloaked figure with a strange symbol on its cloak that looks like circle with a square inside it the figure stops a few few from the cabin and points at Ryker and says some strange jumbled words and a bult of purple lightning strikes Ryker as he rises into the air time stops for all beings.
Scientist: “Thank you Dramiden” *He enters a strange room that was not there before*
The inside of the room looked ancient and in the middle there was podium with a book on it.
Scientist: “Finally, I was worried this book was just a myth” *He picks up the book and teleports away*
Dramiden: *lowers hand and Ryker falls down unconscious when he wakes up doesn't remember anything*
Ryker: *face shifts* “You may be able to wipe his mind, but not mine.” *face shifts back and he gets up* “What happened?”
Scientist: “The beginning has just begun”
Ryker then remembers most of what happened though he doesn't remember the events of the last few days including grabbing young Rae or the dream he saw in Rae’s head
Scientist: *Waves hand and him, Rae, and young Rae disappear*
Ryker: *laughs* “I have counterwards against memory loss.” *teleports Rae and Rain back to him* “Why are you stopping this anyhow?”
Scientist: “Now”
Around Ryker torivors start appearing around him and they all begin to chant and Ryker is trapped in purple lightning once again except this time he can not leave the beam
Scientist: “We are sorry Ryker we are hear to speak with a being inside of you, ???”
Scientist grabs Rae and young Rae and sends them to a faraway place that is hidden to the point where Ryker can not find them
Scientist: “Now, ??? we would like to speak with you.”
Ryker: “Who?” *face shifts* “What do you want.”
Scientist: “You are the only being more evil and powerful then the Ryker” *Pauses for dramatic effect* “You must be contained more Securely In Rykers mind, NOW”
Ryker: *face shifts back* “What are you doing?”
Scientist: “This is to protect the world not from you but from a demon inside of you”
The torivors begin to chant and make motions similar to tidying notes but instead of tying down Ryker the push it in to his head and ??? Is tied down by knots that bind demons at fable haven until the being is completely restrained by them in Rykers head
Scientist: “Sorry to bug you Ryker I just needed to help secure him better”
Ryker: “You really thought that would work? I’m not a demon idiot.”
Scientist: *Rolls eyes* “They are not only for demons they work on all things”
Ryker: *frowns* “Your ‘magic’ does not work on me. Don’t make me mad.”
Scientist: “That is your second mistake of the night torivors do not use magic and lets just say the effects have already done there job”
Ryker: “Well then why am I not restrained hmm?”
Scientist: “This not was not meant to restrain you like how you think they are I think I have explained enough to you I would like to speak with Ryker now”
Ryker: “There’s nothing you can do to stop me. Go ahead.” *face shifts* “What do you want.”
Scientist: “Sorry to speak to you like this, I had a question for you how often does your head hurt or you black out or stop remembering things thathappen.”
Ryker: “It’s occurred more often recently.”
Scientist: *Smiles* “Good that means it should work more efficiently, next time that happens come to me, you may leave now”
Ryker: “Now can you bring me Rae and Rain back?”
Scientist: “I am afraid you will have to talk to Jake about it; Jake you may speak in place of me” *Voice changes to Jake* “Yes, what did you need?”
Ryker: “Bring Rae and Rain back.”
Jake: “First, you must tell me why you want them.”
Ryker: “Because? Rains alone and has no idea what’s going on, and I need to comfort her.”
Jake:”Have you seen all of her past?”
Ryker: “How would I have?”
Jake: “Sorry I forgot, most have not seen the past as much as I have because knowone has yet read that book”
Ryker: “Hohoho! So fancy are we?”
Jake: “I am here to tell you that you taking her is actually what happens that was not a branch that was supposed to happen but you need to change something”
Ryker: “So? It did. Who are you? The TVA from Loki?”
Jake: “No I hate those guys. I can not tell you how many times they have taken me in-- but anyways. she needs to forget that she has ever saw her future self and that you have Harmed lots lots of people”
Ryker: “Why? I don’t see the point. I do this stuff all the time.”
Scientist: “If you do not do that then you will fall very fast not just your powers but you will die, trust me it is bad”
Ryker: “Why? I haven’t died yet? I do this stuff all the time? How do you think you met me?”
Jake: “Would you like me to show you why because if I show you it will probably haunt you at night?”
Ryker: “Isn’t that the whole point of the existence of the multiverse?”
Jake: “If this ending happens then there will be no multiverse left”
Ryker: “You can’t just not have a multiverse. That makes no sense.”
Jake: “It will be easier to show you” *sends them to a vision*
Ryker: “It’s too late now.”
Around them is a being that looks something like Ryker except that the face is slightly different. Then he sees it being released from his head and destroying all life in the multiverse without much effort at all then finally killing the whole Ryker anomaly
Ryker: “That won’t happen because we can beat him, whoever he is.”
Jake: “That being is more powerful than anything in existence and the only thing keeping it from getting out is your head”
Ryker: “But we have teamwork.”
Jake: *Rolls eyes to a point that Ryker thought it was not possible* “If you me and all of the torivors worked together we could theoretically destroy it but it would kill all of us and destroy a lot of universes”
Ryker: “But I can multiply myself. I don’t see the problem. And how does this effect Rain?”
Jake: *Looks at the ground sad* “Because in almost every possible timeline that involves her knowing that she is the one that releases it”
Ryker: “Well all the timelines I exist in, he’s there. What’s the difference?”
Jake: “Because, doing this will give me more time to gather enough power to potentially stop it.”
Ryker: “It’s not like he’s going to pop out of my head tommorow.”
Jake: “Well in one timeline but that is highly unlikely.”
Ryker: “If you don’t give her to me, I will find her, and the same thing will happen. It’s not like you can stop me.”
Jake: “Like I said all you have to do to have her back is to make her forget how evil you can be and too make her forget her future self”
Ryker: “She needs to see the true me, not a fake me.”
Jake: “Exactly, this is the true you.”
Ryker: “All of me is the true me. And it’s not her future self now that I’ve altered the timeline.”
Jake: “Have you listened to a thing I have said you did not change the timeline”
Ryker: “[redacted]”
Jake: “Fine, just please don’t hurt her.”
Ryker: “I never was planning on hurting her you idiot.”
Jake: *Waves hand and Ryker is sent to Rae and Young Rae* “I must make preparations for the end.”
Ryker: “It’s not gonna happen any time soon.” *turns to Rain and Rae* “It’ll be fine you two. Your good. This man..” *gestures to Joke* “Wanted to wipe your mind.” *pauses* “But I stopped him.” *turns to Jake* “Now if you’d excuse us.” *teleports Rae, Rain and him to SOUR*
Jake: *Sends mental message to Rae*“He would not allow me to prevent the end I have told you about, just protect yourself please.”
Rae: “ I will.” 
Ryker: “So Rain, this is my home, feel free 
to explore, and ask me any questions you have. You’re safe now.”
Rain: * doesn’t believe him.* 
Ryker: “Well what can I do to make you believe me.”
Rain: “ you killed two people! How do you expect me to trust you?!” 
Ryker: *frowns* “I guess you can’t. But I’ll try to gain your trust.”
Rain: “ you can certainly try.” 
Rae: * laughs.* 
Ryker: “What!?” *pauses and summons Wiziker* “This Man will get you whatever you want Rain.”
Rain: “ is he a Serial killer too?” 
Wiziker: “I’m a wizard.”
Rain: “ wizards can be serial killers too.” 
Wiziker: “Fair point, but no, I’m not a serial killer, I only kill my breakfast.”
In bound headquarters an alarm is going off while random people in lab coats are going into the different courtyards chanting protection spell over the building and setting up Force fields
Scientist: *Yells over the alarm* “WILL SOMEONE PLEASE TURN OFF THAT ALARM EVERY ONE KNOWS THAT WE NEED START PLACING SAFETY PROCEDURES” *Rolls eyes at the alarm and waves hand and it stops so he can think for one minute* “Well just because the alarm is off does not mean you can stop!”
Trillion: “We have successfully moved the headquarters to a new location so hard to find that hopefully the being will miss us the first few times he comes looking.”
Ryker: *appears* “I can find it in three seconds. That’s a problem.”
Scientist: “Finally good news”
Trillion: “Exactly, this is not the actual headquarters this is just one of many replicas”
Ryker: “Okay then.” *teleports back to SOUR*
Trillion: “How long until it comes out?”
Scientist: “I am hopeful it will be some time but that is very wishful thinking.”
Ryker: *thinks* “Now what do I do.”
Scientist: “Ryker why are you thinking so loudly”*Pauses then finds out it is just outside SOUR*. “Ohhhh, I see”
Ryker: *ding dong ditches Copy of Bound*
Scientist: ”Remind me to turn off my ring doorbell I can already tell this is the first of ment times Also, did you hear someone ate wizikers door knob”
Wiziker: *clears throat* “Well I guess I’m not that funny.”
Cancer:*appears*”no, you're not, i bet your door knob was delicious,  would you like another?”*summons wizikers door, holds out to wiziker, grins, drops door, dances around their blankly staring selves, still grinning, laughing maniacally.*
10 days later
There are now 50 fake bound headquarters they are now working on a few more in the multiverse before they seal the real one the universe they are currently in is [Redacted]
Scientist: “Lets see” *Pauses* “We are almost done with this one, we just need to add a ring doorbell then we are done” *Installs doorbell*
Ryker: *ding dong ditches every BOUND headquarters simultaneously*
Rain: * studies a notebook hard. It has some words and sketches on it. Then looks back to an open book.*
Ryker: *appears* “Whatcha doin?”
Rain: * without looking up.* “ reading.” 
Ryker: *looks at the book*
It is a book on the multiverse.
Ryker: “So then you get the concept of the multiverse, right?”
Rain: “ yeah.” 
Ryker: *snatches book from her* “So what’s exactly in here?” *pages through book for anything interesting*
It is simply the basics of the multiverse.
Ryker: *looks at the notebook* “What’s in here?”
Rain: “ just notes of a sort.”
The notebook has in the center 'multiverse=’ on the other side of the = is a drawing of a key. Next to it there is ‘ you=I’ on the opposite side of the ‘you=I’ is ‘Ryker=father’ in the center of all of this is an arrow going in a circle pointing to its end in the center of it is the word never ending. At the bottom there is a key table. On the left side there is a drawing of a key, the words you, I, Ryker, father, and the circle. On the right side next to the key is the word multiverse, and next to ‘Ryker’ is the word ‘Ryker’. At the top is the phrase ‘ Everything is not what it seems.
Ryker: “Paranoid much?” *looks at her* “It’s not like Rae is an alternate version of future you or anything.”
Rain: * eyes light up.* “ oh yeah probably not.” 
Ryker: “Crap. I was way too obvious wasn’t I?”
Rain: * mumbles something and takes back her notebook and begins to write.*
Ryker: “I might as well tell you why I abducted you. I was bored. That's it. I saw your life in Rae’s memories and felt bad, so I thought I’d raise you better.”
Rain: “ Then why did you leave me in the first place?” 
Ryker: “I didn’t know you existed.”
Rain: * mumbles something, then continues to write.” 
Ryker: “I’m literally giving you anything you want, and you choose to spend your time writing in a notebook? Really?” *shrugs* “You do you.” 
Rain: * grabs book, and reads it.*
Ryker: *Opens door to multiverse* “Just let me know when you want to talk, I’ll just go abduct you again.”
Rain: “ NO! DON’T DO THAT!”
Ryker: *shrugs* “Why? You obviously don’t like me.”
Rain: “ it's not that i don’t like you. You just kinda scare me. And I don't think there's any universe where I'm instantly going to trust you.”
Ryker: “Really? I think there is.”
Rain: “ just, don’t.” 
Ryker: “I don’t think there’s anything you can do to stop me.”
Rain: “ no there isn’t. But I'm telling you that this isn’t going to work how you want it to. You're just going to try and try over and over and nothings going to work, and you'll have done that before you even tried to just get the one to like you.” 
Ryker: “I can be quite smart in the ways I do things.”
Rain: “ Ohh. like how you thought it was such a good and smart idea, to storm into the place an eight year old lives, kill two of her roommates, then abduct her, and try and get her to trust you. Wow, such thinking ahead.”
Ryker: “I get it. But I can change my mindset in a second.” *pauses and his face looks sad, and he acquires a limp* *sadly* “I’m looking for my daughter. I regretted giving her away, but I just couldn’t support her! I am confident that I can now, and that she will have a great life. Her name is Rain.”
Rae: “ Wow, again? You want to do this, again. This time I'm not going to cover for you. Also you think she's going to trust you by LYING to her?!” 
Ryker: “She didn’t trust me when I was truthful.”
Rae: “ ummm when have you ever been honest to her?” 
Ryker: “5 seconds ago.”
Rae: * shakes her head.* “ even when you gave her a huge puzzle piece you weren't being honest.”
Ryker: “How?”
Rain: “ what are you talking about? I tried, and I was close to figuring it out but I have no idea what you said means.”
Ryker: *has a look of realization* “Oooooh, it’s because she thinks I’m her father! No, that’s a different Ryker. One I killed soon after you were born.”
Rae: “ Ryker, you killed my father when I was 5.” 
Ryker: *shrugs* “Well, I mean, that’s soon after you were born to a person who’s lived for millenia.”
Rain: “ WHAT?! You killed my parents?! Why would you DO THAT?!” 
Ryker: “So they wouldn’t kill me.”
Rain: “ They wouldn't do that! You were just being an irrational KILLER!” 
Ryker: “I’m being irrational? Think about it. I, a being trying to take over the multiverse, would not be prevented in any way from conquering if another version of me decided to take over, or try and stop me. I’m just glad I thought of it first.”
Rain: “ the multiverse? So you're a really bad guy?!” 
Ryker: “A bad guy? Is that how people see me? I just want to make sure people don’t make mistakes thanks to idiotic rulers and chaos. I’m not a bad guy. If anyone’s evil, it’s Axolotl.”
Rain: “ mistakes are how we learn. And sure it will never be perfect but it's still how we learn.” 
Ryker: “Why make mistakes when you can just be perfect right off the bat?”
Rain: “ Nothing worth having is ever free.” 
Ryker: “Which is why I have to kill people who get in my way. Do you think it doesn’t take a toll? Or have an impact on me? Really? You see me as a monster, but all things come with sacrifice.”
Rain: “ but it's not worth doing is it? There's something in your way. This Axolotl person. They will stop you!” 
Ryker: “Why not join him then? Hmm? I give you everything. All you’d get from him is pain and suffering for something you ‘think is right’”
Rain: “ you've already caused me more pain and suffering than you can fix!”
Rae: “ Wow, and you're not even 12 yet.” 
Ryker: “Fine then.” *teleports Rain to Hestuia* “This was your choice.”
Hestuia: *sees Rain suddenly appear* “I’ve been waiting for you. Follow me.”
Rain: * nods and follows.*
Hestuia: *leads Rain through [redacted], across [redacted] and underneath [redacted] until he finally ends up in a small area, with white walls.* “Welcome to CARD. Or, Clan against Ryker Domination, we’re currently rebranding however to People Against Ryker Tyranny, or PART. Let me introduce you to Axolotl.” *leads her to another small room*
Axolotl: “Oh! Hestuia and Rae? Why did you bring her to us?”
Hestuia: “This is Rain, an alternate version of Rae, please talk to her and introduce what we do.”
Axolotl: *waves Hestuia off* “You can leave us.”
Hestuia: *leaves*
Axolotl: “You must have many questions. Shoot.”
Rain: “ You're going to stop Ryker. Right?” 
Axolotl: “Not just Ryker, but anyone who tries to claim the shards.”
Rain: “ what can I do to help?” 
Rae: “ I think she means what can we do?” 
Axolotl: *raises eyebrows* “Really? All right. Rae, I need a person on the inside. Can you be that person?”
Rae: “ If you mean a spy then yes.”
Axolotl: *nods* “And Rain, I need to know a bit more about you before I can figure that out.” 
Rain:  “ like what?” 
Axolotl: “Just some basic skills and such.”
Rain: “ I can turn invisible and make force fields.” 
Axolotl: *nods* “And copy powers. That I know, just like Rae, anything else, just skills in general, like what are you good at.”
Rae: “ Well she's young but she's got experience with monsters.” 
Rain: “ and i could-” * looks down sadly.* 
Axolotl: “what?”        
Rain: “ I could use supper strength and speed. And had super senses.”
Axolotl: *nods* “Any idea on what you could do?”
Rain: “ i still could. I just dont like to anymore.” 
Rae: *  looks down at mechanical watch, sadly.*
Axolotl: “The watch is?”
Rae: “ That's what it does.” 
Axolotl: “It watches?”
Rae: “ No, it's the source of the super strength and speed.” 
Rain: * looks like she's going to cry.*
Axolotl: “Does it not work anymore?”
Rain: “ it still works.” 
Axolotl: “Then what’s wrong with it?”
Rain: “ it just makes me sad to think about.” 
Axolotl: “Why?”
Rae: “ It reminds her of Kai. us of Kai.” 
Axolotl: “Kai? Is that like a crush or something?”
Rae: “ no he was my best friend. He died.” 
Axolotl: *mutters* “I shouldn’t do this…but…if you want…I could…” *clears throat* “Save him.”
Rae: “ no. no. That's ok. His death made me the person i am now. It hurts but i need to have that experience.”
Axolotl: *nods* “That’s what I thought.” *frowns* “I should probably introduce you to the rest of us. Rae, you know all of them, Mimick, Smile, Snape, *intense coughing noises*, Hestuia, and I.”
Rae: “ How did Wiziker know who you were?” 
Axolotl: *shocked* “He did!?” *mutters* “Well that shouldn’t have happened.”
Rae: “  Well if he hadn't then you wouldn't have had a spy.”
Axolotl: *raises eyebrows* “Why? Is he the one who informed you about me?”
Rae: “ yes. When I first met him, he told me to find you. I've been trying to find you forever. I've been purposely slowing Ryker down too.” 
Axolotl: “Well I don’t know how he knows, but I should probably inform him that he, in fact, can join us if he’s keeping us a secret from Ryker.”
Rae: * nods.*
Axolotl: “Do you mind if I shield your mind? It’s to protect from Ryker figuring out our location.”
Rae: “ That's fine. And for backup I used a dreamcatcher to scramble my dreamscape to anyone but me and who I choose to see the real thing.” 
Back at SOUR
Cancer:*appears, no one’s there, begins to wander around SOUR mindlessly*
Ryker begins to hear a tune that feels creeply familiar. He begins to recognize the song and the second he recognizes it he begins to be paranoid where it is coming from and how it is being played then it stops and a voice says in his head: “The end has come and gone many times before time is an illusion, space is a theory, SOUR is in the hands of people who have regret!” Then the voice is gone
Scientist: *Teleports to ryker* “Good news I finished all of the replicas of bound headquarters!”
Ryker: “Really? It’s not like I ding dong ditched them or anything…”
Rae: * back at SOUR.* “sup Cancer.” 
Scientist: “This is the last time you can doorbell ditch me before I hide the entrance of all of the Bound’s”
Ryker: *shrugs* “Okay.” *returns to SOUR* “So what exactly are you doing here, Cancer?”
Rae: “ wandering mindlessly.” 
Ryker: “Okay then?”
Cancer:”looking for you, and I guess I have a Rae now, too.”*looks at Rae*” I was wandering and crawling through vents, I didn’t find anything in the rooms”*is sad* “but I found a random flute in a vent. It sounds pretty.”*grins happily*”I have it right now, would you like to hear it, Rae?”*holds out flute*”Its engravings are really beautiful.*feels engravings*
Rae: “ Wait, you found that in the vent. Why are you playing it?!” 
Ryker: *squints* “Hmmm… I feel like this is a trap…but go ahead and play it.”
Cancer:*puts flute too mouth, plays a beautiful lullaby*”This is a song that where I come from, is used to put babies to sleep, it’s about not fearing death”
Ryker: “So it’s useless to me. And it has no relative connections.”
Cancer:”it’s still pretty” *sends to pocket dimension in void*
Ryker: *nods* “I see you also are educated on pocket dimension usage.”
Cancer:”I was taught by the windspren.”
Ryker: *nods* “Okay.”
Cancer:*waves hand in front of Rae’s face*”guess she’s out, time to play a prank”*grins*
Ryker: “Whatcha thinkin?”
Cancer:”is there a way to make it look like all the Rykers have returned? I think they should all chase her to a fake bound.”
Ryker: “Why? I don’t see the point.”
Cancer:”idk, not really, but what point are pranks?”
Ryker: “We can do much better. Come on. Give me something good.”
Cancer:”hmm, how about every time she Stubs her toe, when it’s about to heal, she will always stub it again.”
Ryker: “You monster. That’s evil.”
Cancer:”I have another one about an itch that moves whenever you try to scratch it.”
Ryker: “Why! Why would you ever do that.”
Cancer”why would you ever play a prank?”
Ryker: “These aren’t pranks. They’re torture.”
Cancer”ok, why don’t we just stick her in to a scrolling thingy so that she can never get out until she falls over on her face. I’m mean.”
Ryker: “Or we can just teleport her into the middle of a white blank endless void. She’ll die of silence.”
Cancer:”or that, or we could stick her into her box riddle.”*grins*
Ryker: “I mean we could swap her clothes for one’s that look exactly opposite of what they are. Or we could do both!”
Cancer:”yessss! Where are we going to get clothes that are exactly opposite of each other?”*begins looking under things, pulls out a set of opposite clothes*”is good”
Ryker: “I mean or…” *he snaps and the clothes Rae’s wearing morph*
Cancer:*laughs*”ok, what next? Oh! Let’s trap her in a wall of tiny Rae’s”*summons tiny Rae’s and begins building a wall*
Ryker: “All the way around? Okay!” *starts cloning Cancers Rae walls*
Cancer:”oh yeah, it’s all coming together”
Ryker: “Do we want to do anything else?”
Cancer:”naa, let’s just leave her.”*walks away playing lullaby on flute quietly*
Ryker: *shrugs* “Ima mess with her more.” *grabs a sharpie and draws a mustache on her face*
Cancer:*gives thumbs up * wanders off*
Ryker: *calls* “Don’t be stupid!”
Rae: * laughs. She turns uninvisible, it turns out the Rae they were messing with was a decoy.* “ I wanted to see what you would do. Well I'm off.” *disappears and goes into her backpack.*
Ryker: *sighs* “Well that was disappointing.” *pauses* “I should do something. How about I abduct another character from earlier in the timeline…hmmm…eenie meenie mineey YOU.” *teleports Cancer to him* “So. I’m curious. Where are you from, what’s your backstory?”
Rae: * from backpack.* “ I wouldn’t tell him if I were you.” * Rae appears to be using strong magic.* 
Ryker: “What! Why?”
Rae: “ you'll regret it!”
Cancer:”no, because i like me, and Rae is truthful, most of the time.”*punches decoy Rae*
Decoy Rae:*falls over*
Ryker: “Come on…give me your backstory.”
Rae: “ It's not going to happen Ryker. Also when have I not been truthful?” 
Ryker: “It will. I can be convincing.”
Rae: “ oh yeah like how you tried to convince me you were me from the future TWICE! Ya how'd that work out for you?”
Ryker: “Amazingly well. Surprisingly.”
Cancer:”I don’t think that it did.”
Ryker: “It sorta did. So what’s your mother’s name, your social security number, your childhood address, and the universe you’re from?”
Cancer:”no”
Ryker: “Why?”
Cancer:”because you don’t need to be abducting little me, and i don’t have a social security number”
Ryker: “Come on…”
Cancer:”why do you even need to steal little me?”
Ryker: “I want to start the small squad.”
Cancer:*glares*”What even is that, plus, you're going to have a hard time finding little me, because I didn't even know where I was. Sooo… no you don’t get to take little me”
Ryker: “How did you not know where you were?”
Cancer:”I didn’t interact well with other people, so they never told me where i was, plus, you don’t need to alter my whole backstory. I like it the way it is”
Ryker: *grabs a piece of her hair* “I’ll just use this.” *Deages hair, then uses it as a tracking device*
 Cancer:*turns into a certain kind of beatle, squirts flame out at hair, turns back*”you are not stealing little me, plus, i’d just murder her anyways”
Ryker: “You really think you could murder yourself? Good thing I already fireproofed the hair.”
Cancer:*takes hair from him, sends to void to go get eaten by void monster*
Ryker: *teleports it to him* “Nope.”
Cancer:*summons sword, slices hair*
The sword removes the soul from the hair, making it impossible to track
Ryker: *raises eyebrows* “All right.” *rewinds time, then blocks sword*
Cancer:*Glares*”why do you have to be so difficult”*voids around to find Rae*
Ryker: “Well excuse me while I grab small you.” *teleports into the hallway and follows hair*
Cancer:*returns to original world, grins,laughs maniacally*”you won’t find much”
The scene in front of her is a destroyed planet
Ryker: *starts rewinding time until planet is undestroyed*
Rae: * at SOUR.* “ Welp back to my project.” *  hops in backpack.*
Who: * teleports to Ryker.* “ Hey chicken face.” * begins  sponding random crap until the world begins to lag to a point where it can't be repaired.* 
Ryker: *deletes Who and adds more RAM*
Who: * isn’t deleted.* “ haaa. You cannot get rid of meeeee!” * world is still lagging* 
Ryker: “Uh..yes I can.” *ignores who and adds a bunch more RAM* 
*world is still lagging.*
Who: * continues to spawn random junk to spite Ryker.* 
Ryker: *unable to be intractable because he’s hurtling through space and time*
*world is so laggy he can’t tell what is what.* 
Ryker: *adds infinite RAM*
Who: “ hey chicken face. You want to go to Olive Garden and pick olives?” 
Ryker: “First of all, I don’t have a chicken face. Second of all, Olive Garden is not where you go to pick olives.”
Who: “ Then we’re do you go to pick olives, and yes you do have a chicken face.” 
Ryker: *makes his features nonexistent so he doesn’t have eyes ears, mouth etc.* “You go to an olive garden.”
Who: * disappears and reappears with a bucket of olives.* “ guess we’re I got these. Olive Garden.” 
Ryker: “Did you find them in the kitchen?”
Who: “ nope.” 
Ryker: *rolls eyes* “Okay.”
Who: “ I picked them like a sane person.” 
Ryker: “Ah yes. Because that’s what you are.”
Who: “ of course. You want one?” * begins pelting Ryker with olives.* 
Ryker: *makes mouths appear to catch all the olives that Who throws at him*
Who: * yeets axolotls at him.* 
Ryker: *makes mouths appear to catch all the axolotls that Who throws at him*
Cancer:*appears, grabs Rykers mouth and pulls it shut so he gets hit by axolotls*
Scientist: “I am bored let's make thing interesting”*Waves hand and Young Cancer is hidden from all memory of all including Cancer*
Cancer: *glares*”I don't think that what you just did is what I wanted, I would like to remember being little.”*gives major stink eye*
Scientist: “Oops oh well”
Cancer:*glares*”just let me remember my past please”
Ryker: *clears throat* “I would also like to remember her past.”
Meanwhile
Rae: * types into some form of machinery. It beeps and flashes but it's not morse code.*
Ryker: *great at deciphering obscure codes*
Scientist: *Begins to laugh hysterically* “Really then, translate this: 12/15/12_10/1/11/5_19/1/23/19_8/5/12/12/15”
Scientist: “That is strange, normally I can translate most codes the computers give out but I do not recognize that.”
*beeps translate to: exhhgkhfsdbnmhvbjdegjbffhj Hhhhfdfbjgth g.* 
Ryker: *smiles* “Ah yes..exhhgk- hfsdbnmhvbjdegjbffhj Hhhhfdfbjgth g.”
Rae: “ ….. what did you just say?” 
Ryker: “exhhgkhfsdbnmhvbjdegjbffhj Hhhhfdfbjgth g.”
Rae: “ ok . Why did you say that?” 
Ryker: “Yes.” *frowns* “Is the planet alive yet?”
Rae: * shrugs.* “ I dunno. We're in S.O.U.R right now.” 
Ryker: *glances* “Sorry. Wrong body.”
Rae: “ whaaatttt?” 
Ryker: “Oh! Did you not realize that while I’m talking to you, I’m also somewhere else entirely, that’s how I talk to everyone all at once.”
Rae: “ hu. Fancy that.” * continues to press buttons.* 
Ryker: *clears throat* “Whatcha doin?”
Rae: “ ♎︎♋︎♑︎ ■︎♋︎♌︎ ♓︎⧫︎📬︎ ✋︎ ●︎□︎⬧︎⧫︎ ❍︎⍓︎ ⬧︎⧫︎❒︎♏︎♏︎🙵📬︎.” 
Ryker: “Your streak?”

Pi: “Now to do as much destruction to this world as possible.”
Rae: “ ⬥︎♒︎♋︎⧫︎ ♎︎□︎ ⍓︎□︎◆︎ ❍︎♏︎♋︎■︎ ♌︎⍓︎ ⧫︎♒︎♋︎⧫︎✍︎”

Pi: “We shall destroy S.O.U.R. and Ryker.”
Pi: *Threw Ryker into space with an enchanted catapult straight into a black hole, sending him out into the farlands of space from the white hole.
Rae: “⬥︎♒︎□︎♋︎ ⬥︎♒︎□︎♋︎ ⬥︎♒︎□︎♋︎📪︎ ❍︎♋︎⍓︎♌︎♏︎ ⧫︎♒︎♋︎⧫︎🕯︎⬧︎ ♋︎ ●︎♓︎⧫︎⧫︎●︎♏︎ ♏︎⌧︎⧫︎❒︎♏︎❍︎♏︎📬︎.”

Pi: “01001111 01110100 01110100 01101111”
Ryker: “No.” *rewinds time and imprisons Pi.* “Nope.”
Rae: “ ⚐︎♒︎ ♑︎♏︎♏︎⌘︎.” 
Ryker: *deletes Pi* “No.”
Rae: “ ♑︎♏︎♏︎⌘︎.”
Ryker: “No one is as powerful as me.” *pauses* “And stop speaking in Wingdings or other languages. That’s enough. If I see Pi again…”
Rae: “✋︎ 💧︎☟︎✌︎☹︎☹︎ ☠︎☜︎✞︎☜︎☼︎ 👍︎☜︎👍︎☜︎!” 
Ryker: “Cease is spelled C-E-A-S-E. Not C-E-C-E. And why?”
Rae: “ ✋︎ ♒︎♋︎❖︎♏︎ ❍︎⍓︎ ❒︎♏︎♋︎⬧︎□︎■︎⬧︎.” 
Ryker: “Is it a part of your game?”
Rae: “☠︎□︎◻︎♏︎✏︎”

Rae: “ ✋︎ ♎︎◆︎■︎■︎.” 
Ryker: “Really. Wow. Rude.”
Rae: “ 🕈︎♒︎♋︎⧫︎ ♎︎♓︎♎︎ ✋︎ ♎︎□︎✍︎” 
Axolotl: *voice appears in Rae’s head* “I need you to come. Find an excuse to leave.”

Axolotl: “All right. Great. Everyone’s here.” 
Axolotl, Girl, Snape, Mimick, Smile, and Wiziker are in the small room (With Rain?)
Axolotl: “We’re heading off to get another shard.” *looks to Rae* “You still want to come?”
Rae: “ sure. Did you get my report?” 
Axolotl: *shakes head* “I don’t recall getting a report.”
Rae: “ hmmm odd she should have told you.”  
Axolotl: “Who?”
Rae: “ Rain.” * shows the device she was using earlier.* “ This is like a Morse code device but I’ve been using it with an artificial Morse code I made up when I was younger. I’m the only person who can translate it.” 
Axolotl: *turns to Rain* “So why didn’t you tell me?”
Rain: “ I didn’t get it all translated before you called the meeting.” 
Axolotl: “Whoops! Anyway..some of our other sources..” *glances at Wiziker* “Have told us that we can find a shard in the void, so I say that we search. Anyone up for searching through infinite miles of garbage for a rock?”
Rae: “ I’ve held one before I could use my powers to track it.” 
Axolotl: “Wow! That’s much more convenient…” *pauses* “And to think I would have started going through trash.”
Rae: * teleports away and comes back a few minutes later with the shard of the multiversal gem.* 
Axolotl: “That’s not a shard. And even if it were you shouldn’t just ‘hold’ it like that.”
Rae: “ oh.” 
Axolotl: “If I haven’t explained it before, I’ll explain it again, the shard corrupts.” *sighs* “How do you track? Just bring me to it.”
Rae: “ alright.” * teleports them to shard.* 
Axolotl: *looks around*
They’re standing outside a library
Axolotl: “So…is it inside?”
Snape: *shrugs* “Who wants to go into a dumb library anyways?”
Girl: *silently squeaking in joy*
Mimick: “A Library? Must be a trap.”
Smile: “So who’s going in first?”
Rae: * shrugs.* “ Mimick is right it could possibly be a trap.” 
Mimick: “See! The idiot girl agrees with me.”
Axolotl: *pauses* “Idiot Girl?” *purses lips* “How about we all go in together.”
Rae: “ I’m alright with that, and I’m not an idiot. Just because you were a part of me for a time doesn't mean you know everything about me.” 
Mimick:  *shrugs* “You were stupid enough to drink me.”
Rae: “ I didn’t know you were in there.” 
Mimick: “Ah yes, drink a random liquid from a bounty hunter. Smart.”
Rae: “ I didn’t.. whatever.” 
Mimick: “I say we send in the small version of this one *points to Rae* so that even if that one dies we still have another.”
Rain: * shakes her head.* 
Mimick: “Why? It’s not like Ryker won’t make another one.”
Axolotl: “I’ll go in first.” *walks in*
He sees bookshelves up to a human
gous ceiling, and can’t see the other walls. There’s a librarian sitting at her small desk.
Axolotl: *turns around* *shouts* “I think it’s safe, you guys can come in*
Librarian: *shhs him*
Snape: *shrugs* “Sure.” *walks in*
Girl: *follows behind Snape*
Smile: *frowns* “I’ll go in too.”
Mimick: *smiles* “Idiots first!” *extends arm to open the door for both Rae and Rain. He pauses* “or should I say idiot.”
Rae: * decided to ignore him walkes in.* 
Mimick: “You too little idiot.”
Rain: “ uhhh after you?” 
Mimick: “No thanks, idiots first.”
Rain: “ Yeah, you said idiots first, that means you.” 
Mimick: “What are you? 6? I bet you don’t even know basic arithmetic.”
Rain: “ I know arithmetic. I also know an idiot when I see one.” 
Mimick: “Takes one to know one.”
Rain: “ yeah it does.” 
Mimick: “So after you.”
Rain: “ idiots first.” 
Mimick: “Which you said you were.”
Rain: “ but I’m not. But I know who is. He’s standing in front of me.” 
Mimick: *pushes Rain through the door, then walks through the door*
Fate: *starts eating random things.*
Ryker: “No.” *eats fate*
Rae: * turns invisible.*
Who: * Bursts into Library.* “ YOU GUYS! I've been thinking, don't ice cubes swim in puddles of their own blood!  We cut down bird houses, to make more bird houses. If you drop a bar of soap on the floor, is the floor clean or the soap dirty?!”
Scientist: *Waves hand and jeff is sent to the farthest reach of the multiverse because Present Author sent him a strange urge*
Librarian: *waves hand and Who is shut up, and muted* “Shhh.”” *glares at the rest of them* *harsh whisper* “What do you want!”
Rain: * in a whisper.* “ Well I don’t know what you guys came in here for but I am going to get a book.”
Scientist: “Librarian, would you hand me my key to my private study area.”
Who: “ think about it.” 
The librarian gives him a key and he is sent to a private area of the library that is hidden
Pi: “we need to think of a way to be able to make this life longer, and Ryker, I have stopped doing  the Ones and Zeros.”
Rain: * goes off to find a book.*
Pi: * Follows.*
Pi: “Hey, I found a book on Ones and Zeros, it says 1011101 1010001 1010011 1000010, which translates to the location of Gibberland, where they speak the ancient language of Gibberish.”
Rain: * whispered* “ Ummm good for you I guess?” * goes off on her own to find a book.*
Axolotl: *turns to Mimic and whispers* “So we’re looking for a shard here?”
Mimic: *shrugs*
Rae: * whispers.* “ yep.” 
Axolotl: *whispers to Librarian* “Do you know where we can find a shard of a gem ma’am?”
Librarian: “Why yes! However, a man told me to keep it here till he arrived.” *pauses* “It was the oddest thing!” *frowns* “But I’m afraid while doing some shelving, I lost the shard. I was shelling in the AA’s though, so it shouldn’t be too hard to find!” *she waddles over to a bookshelf then flickers and frowns* “It’s not here.” *she waffles back to the register* “I’ll check the register for recent checkouts.” *pages through notecards* “I don’t use computers, they are too bulky.” *pulls out card* “Why yes! I remember him! This man, I believe his name was..” *checks card* “A mister Johnson I believe. He didn’t say his first name though..just made some odd jokes about rocks, crevasses, and the like.” *hands card to Axolotl* “Here. I think you’ll need this more than me.” *pauses* “Just make sure to bring back the book he checked out if you end up with it, something like, Quantum Physics and Infinite poles, and how to abuse your scientist.” *pauses* “Now that’s an interesting read.” *frowns* “Well good luck, and let me know how it pans out.” *she disappears deeper into the library to converse with Scientist.*
Meanwhile, scientist is in his private library books are flying around him as he looks for a book
Scientist: “Where did that book go, oh hear it is”
The book is in a text so old and complex that no being in all of time has been able to read it, except scientists with the use of a few spells.
Scientist: “Finally the infinity book” *Walks to table with a pair of odd looking glasses that have Lens the color of the darkest dark. He sits down and flips to the last page then he puts on the glasses and then he slumps seeming unconscious*
The Scientist's mind is opened up and he can see the book in his mind only as he flips through the book seems to go on forever even though the size has changed in no way.
Scientist: “where is that part I know it is in here somewhere” *He finds the pages* “Ohh, that is how it works, I must make preparations for this.” *He wakes up and gives the key back to the librarian and disappears*
Librarian: “Well thank you.” *grabs the infinity book and reshelves it*
Pi: *HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA*
Rain: * is looking at books.*
Axolotl: *taps Rain on shoulder* “Would you rather stay here? Or come with us to find this Mr. Johnson.”
Rain: * whispers* “ Is anyone else staying?” 
Axolotl: “Probably not.”
Rain: “ Alright, just let me check these out.” * grabs a huge stack of books and goes to check them out.* 
Librarian: “Are you already a member? Or should I print you a library card?”
Rain: “ I already have a card.” * hands librarian her card.*
Librarian: *checks out books* “And your complimentary bag of holding.” *hands satchel*
Ryker begins to feel a strange sensation like he is falling even though nothing is changed he sees everything and everywhere all at once then he returns to normal except now scientist is standing in front of him
Scientist: “OUCH, dang it, well time to try again”
Ryker: *annoyed* “What do you want?”
Scientist: “Nothing, also where am I and what is the date?”
Ryker: “Thursday.”
Scientist: *mumbles: “4 days lost is not too long at all.”*
Ryker: “I could hear that.”
Scientist: “No mater” *Teleports to the land of unicorns and all other things*
Ryker: *eats Scientist in the land of unicorns and all other things*
Scientist: *Teleports out* “Time to try again” *He closes his eyes and begins to concentrate on the surrounding land*
As scientist dose this a rip begins to form around the borders of the universe [X45321(it is uninhibited)] he is in then it fades around him and he is launched temporarily in to area that shows all universes as this happens he is sent back and then he is knocked out 
Ryker: *eats scientist and laughs* “Ya do realize that you need a constant source of power to do that, right.” *he winces in pain and raises his hand to his forehead*
Pi: *Interrogates leftovers of scientists' bodies.”
Rain: * stuffs the enormous pile of books in her backpack.*
Pi: *Takes books and translates to binary code*
Rain: “ Ummmmm…. Ok?” * takes books back.*
Pi: “Ummmmm…. Ok?” * takes books back.*
Rain: * Grabbes books and teleports away.*
Pi: * Grabbes books and teleports away.*
Rain: * still has her books.*
Axolotl: “Let’s go!” *gathers group* “So we’ve got a name. That’s it. So…? What do we do with a name? Only a last name too. Johnson. That's it?”
Wiziker: *shrugs* “Just use the multiversal white pages.”
Axolotl: “The what?”
Wiziker: “Oh, Ryker made a database of everyone in the multiverse, called the MWP, or the multiversal white pages.” *clears throat* “But…it’s only accessible on the SOUR WiFi hotspot.” *clears throat* “Which Ryker might get suspicious of me, or Rae, or almost anyone else in this group. We need a scapegoat.”
Scientist: “OUCH, finally I know it is possible for it to collapse without the time barriers. Let’s see how many did I make it through.” *Checks device in pocket* “Wow, that was closer than I thought.” *Pauses* “and I was only gone for 2 days” *has an idea and teleports away*
As he leaves some very high quality wall dust falls out of his pocket
Ryker: *looks at THE author* “Are you thinking what I’m thinking?”
THE Author: “His dnd campaign character, or one of your universes. And he thought I was bad at just referencing Wiziker.”
Ryker: *nods* “Hypocrite.”
Scientist: “I can still hear you and no I am not”
Ryker: “Sure…” *pauses* “Prove it.”
Scientist: “First off that is not wall dust,… that is roof dust obviously”
Ryker: *pauses* “A ceiling is a wall if you walk on walls.”
Scientist: “No, a roof is not a ceiling”
Ryker: “A ceiling is just relative to the direction of your gravity.”
Scientist: “Not necessarily, also I would like to introduce you to an associate of mine.”
Ryker: “You said too, not to.”
Scientist: “He is a roofer, he will explain the difference of A ceiling and a roof”
 Roofer: “Yes there is a large difference…” *Gives 2 hour presentation in the history and differences*
Ryker: “Well yes, but we were talking about ceiling dust, not roof dust.”
Scientist: “No that was roof dust that fell out not ceiling”
Ryker: *Mimics Scientist word for word* “First off that is not wall dust,… that is roof dust obviously”
Scientist: “That is exactly what I said”
Ryker: *sighs* “Fine, I misheard roof for ceiling.”
Scientist: “Good, now I have some work to do with…” *pauses* “stuff” *teleports away*
Back at the Library
Mimic and Smile: *look at Wiziker*
Snape: “I mean, he doesn’t know what happened to me and my sis, so we could go…”
Girl: *shakes head in disagreement.*
Hestia: “Yeah, not happening for me. He’d get suspicious.”
Mimic: “I say either Are or Wiziker. Or I mean Rain could go and say that she gave up trying to find us, but that would also be suspicious.”
Smile: *nods*
Wiziker: *bites tongue* “I mean, since SOURis technically in a pocket dimension, and the hotspot is the universe that is containing the pocket dimension, I could just go there, and it would probably be less risky.”
Mimic: *nods* “I say he does that. Everyone else is in agreement.”
Snape: “Sure.”
Hestia: “It’s our best plan.”
Axolotl: “Yeah, go ahead.”
Rae: “ yeah im fine with it.”
Rain: * isn't paying attention because she is reading.*
Wiziker: *disappears and reappears* “That was surprisingly easy.” *he has his tablet open* “Now that these pages are open, unless I close or refresh the page, we should be able to access this.” *he types a few things into the tablet* “All right, so Ryker’s SOUR cameras…”
Axolotl: “Which we’re shielded from.”
Wiziker: “say that the man was Cave Johnson, from universe P53.” *nods* “I should have expected that.” *turns to Axolotl* “Let’s go.”
Axolotl: *opens a portal*
Wiziker: “Just note, the beings in this universe are quite different to the ones we have met, because they are not under Rykers power, so BE CAREFUL. We may be separated, or prevented from using our powers. So good luck.” 
Axolotl: *nods and pushes the portal into them., sending the group through*
Author: soooooo, this is [redacted] I’m in charge of this section of the roleplay so I’ll be doing narration and stuff.
The group gets flung out of the portal into a room. It is made of white and black panels and what appear to be robotic arms that you can see from the holes in the wall. The whole area appears to be overgrown. There is a large red button and a cube on the far side of the room.
Axolotl: *grabs cube and begins to wall climb*
Snape: *press the button continuously.*
Rest of the gang: *waits*
Looking behind, the group sees a large portal structure that appears to be off. On the side of it it says A.S.Q.T.D. 
Axolotl: *tries to turn on device, banging on it and such*
Snape: *picks up cube, and places it on button* 
Wiziker: *sarcastically* “Witchcraft.”
The door opens revealing a massive room with a giant vault style door (see here) There are several observing rooms at the top of the room. There are several devices in the center of the room and a glowing particle field in between.
Group: *walks into room*
Axolotl: *grabs device*
Wiziker: *grabs device*
Girl: *grabs device*
Snape: *grabs device*
Smile: *grabs device*
Rae: * grabs device*
Rain: *grabs device*
Mimic: *breaks device in anger* “IT’’S A TRAP!
Author: “I mean I guess that’s true. Wait, I'm not supposed to talk crap!” *irritated* “Just open the door.”
Axolotl: *goes to one button by scaling wall*
Wiziker: *goes to the other button by climbing wall*
Both: *press buttons*
Loud noises and alarms and bright lights as the door opens.
???: *from a faraway speaker* “Hello? Who’s there?”
Wiziker: “Me.”
???:”Who is that? Who said that? How did the door open?”
Wiziker: “I pressed the button.”
Axolotl: “And so did I.”
???:”How did you get here?”
Axolotl: “Through a portal.”
???:”this is going nowhere. Get in here.”
Group: *walks in*
There appears to be another test chamber but the only thing in it is a white security camera with a red eye. A voice comes out of the camera.
???: “What an odd group to come out of the portal. 
Wiziker: “Says the camera.”
Axolotl: “Yeah. We ain’t scared of no camera.”
???: *ominously* “Oh I’m much more than a camera.
Wiziker: “Yeah, she’s GLaDOS, a machine in the game Portal, and the antagonist of the series, Chell defeated her.”
GLaDOS: *in an creepily quiet voice* “I beg your pardon?”
Wiziker: “Honestly, she’s quite an easy boss to beat, and her ‘tests’ are quite easy. I can’t see how so many people died on them.”
GLaDOS: “let’s see how you think of me now.”
A panel opens up and another one shoves Wiziker out of the test chamber and into the pit to the incinerator.
GLaDOS: “that’s what you get for breaking the fourth wall. I mean he’s already dead.”
Wiziker: *makes his way back to the room quickly*
Snape: *put the portal on the wall with the camera and somewhere else to break the camera.*
GLaDOS: “To ensure the safe performance of all authorized activities, do not destroy vital testing apparatus. How do you even know how to operate the Aperture Science Handheld Portal Device anyways?”
Snape: “You press the button. It’s not that hard.”
GLaDOS: “Well seeing as you're here, I could use some new test subjects. Atlas and P-body can be discarded for the time being.”
Wiziker: “I mean how are you planning on making a 8 person test chamber?”
Scientist: *Telaports to GLaDOS then plugs device into her then unplugs the device after it pings and nothing changes to her or any thing else*
Scientist then claps his hands and then the device disappears now he teleports to Wiziker
Scientist: *Grabs the hat*
Wiziker: *insulted* “But I do have somewhere to be…” *pauses* “Do you mind teleporting me?” *gives odd instructions on the form of teleportation* “I’ll be back.”
Scientist: *Follows him invisible*
Warning: Entering early may result in death, destruction, violence, and other forms of danger
Scientist: *Gose back on a strange urge*
Wiziker: *begins unlocking certain barricades and mind-messages Ryker* “Tell Scientist that he could go through currently, but he would just end up seeing an odd frozen world.” 
Ryker: *does so*
scientist: “You did not need to do that, I can hear every Ryker always, trust me it is so hard to sleep”
Wiziker: *shrugs* “Okay, but are you ready to enter MY domain. Ryker may be powerful, but, in my universe, I could squash him like a bug.”
Ryker: *shrugs* “He’s right.”
Scientist: “Do not worry, I am not planning to enter yet, but I am going to seal it off until[REDACTED]” *seals it off*
Wiziker: *gets cut off* “I will open …”
A little while later a portal opens in front of each essential character
Wiziker: “You may begin.”
Since no one arrived, the portals close
Wiziker: *leaves and returns to area, being respectful by passing through the emancipation grill again*
Rae: * looks at GLaDOS.* “ are they…… dead?” 
Wiziker: “Oh, they’re just robots.”
Meanwhile in Bound(The location has been scrambled and changed)
Scientist: “Lets see, 3 down 1 to go, where next”
Hestuia: *appears* “I feel I was unneeded there, so I came here. You’re fine with that right?”
Scientist: *Looks kind of confused* “I mean I do not necessarily need you but you can stay” *Begins typing on a computer*
Hestuia: “Whatcha doin?”
Scientist: “I am doing some work right now.” *A voice come on the computer says: “Finaly I am so GLaD to be out of that place” then it is shut down agian*
Hestuia: “You do realize that GLaDOS is not that clever with wordplay, she’s just sarcastic.”
Scientist: “Realy I had no Idea” *Rolls eyes*
Hestuia: “Why confine her to a computer? There are so many other ways to make her interesting.”
Scientist: “Trust me If I could I would, I can only connect to her temporarily before the connection gets to unstable, her core is super corrupted, it is 80%”
Hestuia: *grabs potato* “Just use this.”
Scientist: *Hits himself in the forhead* “I am not going to do that trust me it super usless”
Hestuia: “But what about PotaTOS?”
Scientist: “I think it is time for you to leave” *Waves hand and he is sent back*
Hestuia: *uneffected by scientists hand.*
Scientist: “Okay, just do not be to crazy, and also if you use eny light switches never flip the blue ones.” *Continues to type*
Hestuia: “Why?”
Scientist: “Because, I said so.” *Continues to type even faster*
Hestuia: “What do they do?”
Scientist: “They are used for scientific reserch stuff of science”
Hestuia: “What if I flick this one over here…” *puts hand on blue switch*
Scientist: “Pleas do not do that, it is not fully tested”*Keeps typeing*
Hestuia: “What isn’t?” *puts finger in preparation  to flick switch*
Scientist: “This is your last chance do not flick the switch”
Hestuia: “Then tell me what will happen.”
Scientist: “I already told you”
Hestuia: “Not really…”
Scientist: “If you are so determined to flip the switch then just do it. I can not stop you even if I tried as hard as I could” *Continuse to type this time he is going so fast his hands are hard to see*
Hestuia: *plugs in hardrive into computer to get a copy of GLaDOS*
Scientist: “That is not how that works, This is not in anyway connected to GLaDOS, trust me if it was I would alredy be well on my way.”
Hestuia: “Well then just give me a copy I can put in my potato.”
Scientist: “I am still acquiring, most of GLaDOS, when I am done I would gladly give you a copy.”
Hestuia: *nods* “Sure…”
Scientist: “I must leave now” *The whole room disappears and scientist is sent too [REDACTED] with his computer*
Hestuia: “Rude. Fine. Ill go back.” *kindly transports back, then goes through grill*
Meanwhile in [REDACTED]
??: “Did you acquire the pieces”
Scientist: “I have 3 I just need one more, where do you suggest I get the other piece”
??: “Try going to [REDACTED] and find [REDACTED]”
Scientist: “I will soon I must go some where else first then I will go to [REDACTED]” *Teleports to Aperture Science*
In Aperture Science
GLaDOS: “Okay I need some help. Upon meeting you I knew I couldn't test with 8 people. But there's something else I need. Will you help me?”
Wiziker: “I don’t know, should we trust the insane AI?”
Scientist: “What do you need GLaDOS?”
GLaDOS: “Atlas and P-Body have gone missing.”
Scientist: “I can do that, when were they last detected and where”
GLaDOS: “They discovered one of the dens of that infernal rat man and have been sneaking around the facility ever since.”
Scientist: “Okay just give me some time so I can grab some of my stuff.” *Telaports back to bound to grab stuff*
Future: Axolotl: *blocks GLaDOS from Ryker’s view and returns to base time*
GLaDOS: “be back here once you have your stuff and we can start. If you can find them, maybe I can even tell you where that gem shard is.”
Axolotl: *rewinds time* “That was close.”
GLaDOS: “Can anybody else help?”
Axolotl: *shrugs* “Sure.”
Rest of Group: *sure*
A door opens revealing a chamber lock with an elevator
GLaDOS: “get in.”
Axolotl: “You expect us all to cram in this elevator?”
GLaDOS: “You know most humans don’t complain as much when i cram them into things. Of course most of the time their dead. But if you really want I’ll add another elevator.”
Axolotl: *sighs* “Just expand the size of this one.”
GLaDOS: “fine then you don’t get an elevator. Just ride down the tube.”
Group: *Jumps down tube*
Scientist sneezes and universe Z447523849750923487509234875 is destroyed
Ryker: *fixes universe*
Who: “ hey chicken face! “ * spans madness.* 
Ryker: *ignores Who*
A strange shift happens in the multiverse an almost in presvible shift that changes everything yet nothing all in a second yet it felt like eternitys then in a far stretch of the multiverse a very old man is sent to A2
Radharc: “My back”
Ryker: “Why HELLO there! I didn’t expect a new character this far in…but GREAT!”
Radharc: “Excuse me young whippersnapper, do you happen to know where the nearest cafe is?”
Ryker: “I’m older than you.”
Radharc: “Yes but where is the nearest cafe” *Decides that he is no help and hobbles off to the nearest cafe*
Ryker: *sighs* “The last time I prevented someone from going somewhere, they died. But…” *teleports him back to him*
Radharc: “Ohh thank you I was going the wrong way, also do I know you let me grab my glasses” *Puts them on*
Ryker: “Aren’t you blind or something?”
Radharc: “YOU, I thought I recognized your voice it is nice to finally meet you”
Ryker: *raises eyes* “When did you meet me? Not in A1 recently, right?”
Radharc: *Chuckles* “Yes, I have herd about the ‘Ryker anomaly’ You're famous throughout the multiverse”
Ryker: *sighs* “Why does everyone call me an anomaly? I’m just as logical as anything else, and am only unique because I killed others like me.”
Radharc: “Yes, exactly, an anomaly can happen by doing this.”
Ryker: *eats a cheeto puff* “Okay then.” *stares deeply at Radharc*
Radharc: “Now, would you tell me where the nearest cafe is?”
Ryker: “Here.” *summons cafe into existence.*
Radharc: “Thank you” *Enter cafe and orders a chocolate croissant*
Ryker: “Really? A chocolate croissant?” *pulls something out from under the bar table* “This is a..” *random shrieking noises* “...it translates roughly to pig chocolate. Trust me. It’s good.” *eats some.*
Radharc: “Well, I think I will stick with my chocolate croissant”
Ryker: “So whatcha doin?”
Radharc: “I have a meeting I must go to in a few minutes, so if you do not mind I need to leave now”
Ryker: *eats pickle and points it at him* “I don’t care, as long as I can come.”
Radharc: “I am afraid that I am not allowed to do that.” 
Ryker: “Fine, I’ll just follow you without permission.”
Then ???(Jakes) enters and uses his abilities to hide Radharc and take him to his meeting with GLaDOS
Radharc: “GLaDOS it good to see you”
Meanwhile…In SOUR
Ryker: *waiting, bored* “Where is everyone?”
Cricket: *chirps*
Ryker: *sighs* “Fine, I’ll make my own friend.”
Scientist: *Appears* “Have you seen an old man, gose by the name Radharc?”
Ryker: “Yeah, why? He’s not that old.”
Scientist: “You would be surprised he is not as old as you but, he is very old, Where did you see him?” *Seems to be very stressed*
Ryker: “At me Cafe. ARGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGH!” *puts on pirate hat*
Scientist: “Go away pirate Ryker nobody cares about you”
Ryker: *disapointed* “Arggh.” *Ryker smiles* “Ya get me instead. Good enough?”
Scientist: *Enters Rykers mind*
Inside Rykers Mind
Lazy Ryker: “Nice to see ya again Scientist.”
Hyper Ryker: *jumping around room* “I see rainbows.”
Mind Scientist: “How much sugar did he have?”
Lazy Ryker: “You saw Ryker eat that Cheeto right?”
Mind Scientist: “Ohh, that is why.”
Evil Ryker: “What do you want.”
Mind Scientist: “I needed to know where exactly Radharc” *Kicks Pirate Ryker So hard that he is knocked out.*
Pirate Ryker: “ARRRRGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGH!”
Secret Ryker: “Shhh. I’m not here.”
Scientist: *Uses UV light*
Meta Ryker: “I mean I’m the closest to UV light.”
Scientist: “WILL ANY OF YOU ANSWER MY QUESTIONS”
Bob: *slurps smoothie* “Nope.”
Scientist: “YOU GUYS SUCK”
Hyper Ryker: * continues jumping around. * “ I've got the zoomies! I SHALL NEVER CEASE!” 
Lazy Ryker: *blinks* “Something’s off about Hyper.”
Meta Ryker: “Looks like author's handiwork.”
Bob: *nods* “Yep.”
Chaos Ryker: “We should set him free. Just use the splitter ray. It’ll make our life easier.”
Logic Ryker: *shocked* “Are you insane! That could destroy the multiverse! We’re the only ones preventing that from happening!”
Judge Ryker: “I honestly don’t care, as long as the whole mind calms down.”
Lawyer Ryker: “I bring Insane Ryker to the stand!”
Insane Ryker: “French fries! Anecdotal response! Piglins!”
Lawyer Ryker: “Thank you Insane Ryker.”
Judge Ryker: “Meeting adjourned.”
Annoying Ryker: “We should just flood an ocean with pickles.”
Hyper Ryker: “GREAT IDEA!”
Evil Ryker: “No.”
Hyper Ryker: “Why?”
Bob *slurps smoothie* “Because we’re busy.”
Insane Ryker: “Pork! Google! Mathematics!”
Lazy Ryker: “I agree.”
Ryker: “Let's come to an agreement.”
Stubborn Ryker: “No.”
Basic Ryker: “Meh.”
Special Font Ryker: “WOW! I can see FONTS!”
Meanwhile 
Radharc: *finished his meeting with GLaDOS. He is sent to AXOLOTL* 
Meanwhile
Rain: * looks down from her book sadly and sighs.* “I wish I had a cookie. “
Rae: “ NO! You know good and well why you don't get a cookie or ANY SUGAR for that matter!”
Rain: * sighs.* “ I know.”:,(
Axolotl: *gives Rain a cookie, and some Halloween candy*
Rain: * looks at him.* “ thanks but maybe it’s not the best idea.” 
Axolotl: “Why not?”
Rae: “ one word. Hyperactive.”
Radharc: “Dia duit Axolotl tá sé go deas bualadh leat ar deireadh is é m'ainm radharc. Tá mé ar do sheirbhís.” *Shakes his hand* “Tá súil agam nach miste leat, ní labhraím Béarla go maith, níor úsáid mé é le breis agus 5,000 bliain.”
Axolotl: *clears throat* “Bhuel, b'fhearr liom go mbeadh Béarla againn, áfach, más gá, tá sé sin ceart go leor.” *clears throat* “Il etek mokuhlek stariben svi' Vuhlkansu.” *suddenly realizes he doesn’t know this person* “Bek-tor, vi nam-tor du?” *pauses*
Radharc: “Fine I will go down to english do not mind me if it is rusty.”
Axolotl: “Well, I only speak a finer dialect of English known as Squeakese.”
Radharc: “Yes Yes, but I am here because I have a scheduled meeting with you.”
Axolotl: “Scheduled?”
Radharc: “Yes, I sent you a dream using a very powerful device”
Axolotl: *raises eyebrows* “I don’t sleep.”
Radharc: “Well, I should say it is more like I sent a thought but at night it usually comes out as a dream”
Axolotl: “Oh I don’t care. What do you want? Are you a SOUR spy? A doofus from BOUND, which isn't even an acronym, or what.”
Radharc: “No, actually I have broken away from Bound I am hear because I would like to join”
Axolotl: *bored with the conversation* “Oh, a doofus from BOUND wants to join my elite group. What skills do YOU have?”
Radharc: “Are you sure you can handle this”
Rain: * considers eating cookie.* 
Axolotl: *hands her one* “I may not be able to, but Snape here can.”
Snape: *turns around* “What?”
Axolotl: “Just come over here and let this man use his powers.”
Snape: “Whatever.” *walks up close to Radharc and starts playing games on his phone*
Radharc: “Fine” *Taps cane* 
The area around them changes they began to see and feel each atom all at once it is so overwhelming for them that it is hard to think yet they can also for a moment they can read all of there thoughts then it returns to normal.
Radharc: “That is how I see, this is what I can do with it” *Taps cane*
Snape: *shrugs* “What happened?”
Axolotl: “Decent skill.”
This time all of the atoms around them change, then the room around them changes to felt.
Radharc: “Now the room is much softer”
Snape: *looks around* “Dope.” *lies down on ground and just chills*
Axolotl: *nods* “Respectable. What can’t you alter with those mind-bendy powers?”
Radharc: “I can not do it if the area is larger than about 20 square feet, and it has to be connected to the time stream”
Axolotl: “Do you know about the shards?”
Radharc: “Yes, I helped bound catalog there locations”
Axolotl: “Sure, but have you ever tried to…I don’t know…change them?”
Radharc: “I know the theory behind doing it, but it is very very strenuous to even attempt”
Axolotl: “Would you like to try? I’ve got Mimick over here that can double your power.”
Radharc: “Okay, let me just do something” *Taps cain and makes a chair to sit in and a table made of steel* “I am good now, bring me Mimick and the gem”
Mimick: *walks over and copies ability* “I mean we can try.”
Axolotl: *disappears, and reappears wearing gloves, and holding a shard, then places it on the table*
Radharc: “Okay, first to make this Simpler for Mimick, I need you to put on a blind fold,The change is so complex that looking directly at it will most likely Knock You out for a day or two, It is hard to look at it with my power already, I can not begin to think what it will do when it is doubled”
Mimick: “Well…alright.” *puts on blindfold*
Radharc: “Good, Now I need you to empower me or however it works.”
Mimick: *looks at him* “All righty then.” *he puts a hand on Radharc*
Radharc: “Warning, this is going to be a bit intense”
A loud noise begins to play, a screeching of a sort. Some otherworldly material begins to spread from the gem, and then the material begins to creep slowly toward Radharc, trying to touch him
Radharc: “What is happening I can not stop the prosses it is too far along”
Mimick: *slightly in pain* “I’ll try and give you more power.”
The infection suddenly speeds up, and touches his head, and then, suddenly, it stops, leaving the table scared
Mimick: *takes off blindfold, and sees head and jumps back* “Whoa!”
Radharc: “What is it?”
Mimick: *summons mirror* “It’s…kinda…purplish? Like amethyst?”
Radharc: “NO, no, no, that should not have happened, the experiment should not be able to do it, the process has stoped years ago!”*Calms himself*”Let me try something” *He taps his Cain and a knife appears and stops him self, but as it happens, nothing changes he is dead for a second but the he comes back and is still old.*. “No I should be young again!”
Axolotl: *pauses* “Umm…that probably wasn’t the best idea, was it.”
Radharc: “Trust me, I can die and then when I come back I am much younger”
He hears whispering: “Oh, so like me?”
Radharc: “You are not allowed in my head demon crystal, I will not allow it, I saw you form and shatter, I will not let you speak to my thoughts”
He says: “Well tough. You’re stuck with me.”
Radharc: “STAY AWAY”
Axolotl: “Who are you talking to.”
Radharc: “That demon crystal found out how to link itself to my thoughts.”
Axolotl: “Oh…well. I’m sorry then.” *he holds up his hand and prepares himself*
Redheart (Radharc):“You fools! I will destroy you!”
Axolotl: *frowns* “Goodbye.” *he points his hand and suddenly, Radharc is trapped in some capsule full of a strange liquid* 
Radharc: “Make sure that you give it as much power as you can my body resists changes to its atoms”
Axolotl: *looks at Mimick*
Mimick: *puts hand on Axolotls shoulder*
Axolotl: *slowly turns Radharc to stone*
When he does this the stone shatters to dust.
Radharc: “It needs more power then that” *Rolls eyes*
Axolotl: “Well then how about THIS!”
THE Author: “Wait..I’m getting involved? Oh fine.” *gives plot power to increase Axolotls energy* “There ya go bud.”
Present Author: “Did they seriously, make you help them Lol”
THE Author: *shrugs* “I mean, I gave them some power just to invoke some plot points.”
Present Author: “Okay, how come I have a feeling that this will be quite interesting later in the plot”
Axolotl: *looks up* “Shut up you two!”
Present Author: “Excuse me did some 1’s and 0’s just insult me”
THE Author: “Nope, I take on different minds as I interact. So, in a way, one’s and zeros insulted you through me.”
Present Author: “To be honest I am not sure who to be more annoyed at” 
Author: “. Hold on! Why do you two get to get involved! 
THE Author: “I’m the only one getting involved here. And I am THE Author.”
Present author: “ That’s still feels like Cheating”
Author: “  it still feels unfair.” 
THE Author: “That’s because it is!”
Present Author: “Fine, if you get to cheat then I will also” *Takes away added power*
Author: “ same!”  
THE Author: “I only do it to add some spice to the plot! Who wants a dull plot.”
Present Author: “I am sure there are plenty of people that like boring plots, people like Disney, ROM coms so….”
THE author: “All right! Fine..” *takes away power* “Even though Axolotl's key power is to invoke me.”
Present Author: “Okay I am happy now”
Author: “ I’m pacified.” 
Axolotl: “Well I give up.” *looks at Mimick* “It’s not like we can do a lot to stop him, so.. I’ll just teleport him to Ryker. Then it can be his problem.” *teleports Radharc to Ryker*
Rae: “ wait, why don’t we like this guy again?” 
Axolotl: “He got corrupted from a shard, sorta like you did.”
Meanwhile
Radharc: “I think I know how to divert it” “NO YOU DO NOT DO NOT DO IT”
Ryker: *raises eyebrows* “I do though.” *gives Radharc access to Rykers FULL mind for one nanosecond, almost killing him*
Radharc: “I built this just in case something like this happens” *Puts on a ring and then the voice inside of him is put into the ring*
???: “Well, you might as well just give me to Ryker then.”
Radharc: “Laughs,please why would I do that, I have had to deal with beings like you all the time” *Turns the ring and the voice is sent back into the gem and the ring disappears*
Ryker: “So, you’ve got a voice in your head too? Welcome to the club! Meet Hyper, and Lazy, and Bob!”
Meanwhile 
Rae: * shutters.* “ I hate those shards.” 
Axolotl: “That’s why we’re stopping Ryker from getting them.” *gives Rain a pixie stick*
Rain: “ don’t torture me.” 
Axolotl: “Go ahead, eat it.”
Rain: “ well… if you insist. Also I’m so sorry.” * eats pixie stick. Eyes grow wide and she begins running around with more energy than she knows what to do with* “ SUGAR!!!! MyWightGranulatedFriend!!!!” 
Axolotl: *hands her a couple more sticks and looks at Rae* “This is to build up some tolerance.”
Rae: “ That's probably going to make it worse.” 
Rain: * grabes the sticks.* “ GeeeThanksAxolotle! IShallReinSupprem! AllThePowerIsMine!!!!” * dumps them in her mouth all at once.* 
Axolotl: “Trust me, it’ll help.” *hands her a couple more*
Scientist: “Oh no not again! Rae! get the anti-sugar!”
Axolotl: *gives Rain a bucket of sugar that automatically replenishes* “Trust me. It’ll happen soon.
Rain: * eat the sugar. She continues to get more hyper and is talking much faster.* 
Scientist: *Plunges anti-surge shot into her and all of the auger is neutralised*
Axolotl: “You’re only harming her in the long run.”
Rain:“YourDarkMagicShallHaveNOeffectOnMeeeee!” *rain is still sugar high. Augar has no effect.*
Scientist: “No you do not understand, she gains actual power!”
Then rain begins to puke out all of the sugar
Rain: * uses powers to stop this.* “ YouShallNotTakeMYPower!!!! HelpMeAxolotle!!!!!” 
Axolotl: “I already gave you infinite sugar.”
Rae: “ noooooo what have you done!” 
Rain: *throws a handful of sugar at scientists.* 
Axolotl: “Trust me, it’s just like dopamine.”
Rae: “ no it’s not!” 
Scientist: *Begins to sneeze multiverse Z500. -Z3658 explodes* 
Axolotl: “Every child reaches their sugar peak. Trust me.”
Rae: “ we are HYPERACTIVE!!!” 
Axolotl: “And? You Crash eventually. Come on, have some sugar.” *shoves some sugar in Rae’s mouth*
Scientist: “NO all of the random z universes! I had a vacation home in Z1364”
Rain: “ I see colors!” 
Axolotl: *waits for Rae’s sugar to kick in*
Scientist: “RAIN THAT IS ENOUGH”*creates a strange looking device it*
Rain: “ NEVER!!!!” * throws more sugar at him.* 
Axolotl: “Get Rae to eat some sugar!”
Rae: “ya I’m going to pass.” * turns invisible and creates a force field around herself.* 
Rain: “ ComeOn!ItsFun!” 
Scientist: “Rae I need you to sighed this paper it is a Torivorian contract, it will prevent her from going totally insane”
Axolotl: “Rain! You can get to Rae! Just try!”
Rain: “ Ok!” * is so hyper her powers aren’t working properly so she just makes fireworks appear.* 
Rae: “ I’m a little busy right now. Besides, she won’t go insane, just hyper for a few hours.” 
Scientist: “Exactly, that is because you have already sign the contract, I set it up so she will not explode with it”
Rae: “ So this did absolutely nothing?” 
Rain: * continues running around.* “ SUGAR!!!!!” * begins hitting people with hand fills over sugar.* 
Scientist: *Coughs and M504 explodes then he puts on a mask*
Rain:“IshallRuleAllWithMyNewFoundPower!!!” 
Who: “ immm back suc-“ * She is hit in the face with a handful of sugar and falls over.* 
Ryker: *senses Who’s defeat* “FINALLY! KARMA!”
Axolotl: *gives Rain the densest, most sugar packed object in existence*
Who: * oh I’m still alive, I just wasn’t expecting sugar to the face, chicken face.” 
Rain: * is still hyper. Throws sugar at Rae’s force field.* “ YouCantStayInThereForever!” 
Rae: * is nervous.* 
Snape: *watching the scenario unfold* “Well, if you give me some of the sugar, I can walk straight up to her and put some sugar in her mouth. I ignore other peoples powers entirely.”
Axolotl: *shrugs*
Radharc: *Begins to sing still alive by GLaDOS*
Mimick: *smiles* “This is quite enjoyable to watch… let’s see..Rain, come here for a sec, and I can get you into the forcefield.”
Rain:“IdontTrustYouuuu!YouCallMeAnIdieot.”
Rae: “ Why do you guys want me to get high on sugar so bad?” 
Axolotl: *shrugs* “I just think it would be funny.” *teleports Rain into Rae’s forcefield to cause utter chaos*
Rain:“HiRae!!YouShouldReallyEatSomeOfAxolotlesTreats!!!” 
Rae: “ nope. Never.” * teleports to a random location in the room.* 
Axolotl: *teleports Rain to Rae* “Just force feed her it.”
Rain: * doesn't feel like cooperating so she throws sugar at Axolotl.* 
Axolotl: *shrugs* “You do you kid.”
Rain: * starts throwing sugar at everyone.* 
Axolotl: *aims Rain at Rae*
Rae: * makes it so everything passes through her.*
Axolotl: *shrugs* “Well.” *looks at Rain* “You’ll never be good enough at throwing sugar to get Rae now.”
Rain: * smiles deviously. Starts throwing large amounts of sugar at him.* 
Meanwhile
Who: “ HEY CHICKEN FACE!!!” * has a sugar cube the size of a giraffe, and she proceeds to throw it at Ryker.* 
Who: * rolls it at Ryker. Wait a minute.* “ aww man he's frozen.”
Ryker: “Um? I am?”
Who: “ never mind. Anyway, you want to Rob a bank?” 
Ryker: *smiles* “I have a great idea.” *teleports Who in front of a door* “Go ahead, try and get in.”
Scientist: “If the end is never, then how does, never work? That would mean there was no start, so that means that time will stop at some point” *He says in strange paradoxical voice with no context*
Ryker: “You do realize that makes absolutely no sense.”
Meanwhile, in an unknown area
???: *bangs on a machine* “Why won’t you work! Stupid machine!” *paces back and forth* “This is the only idea I have to access the multiverse.” 
???: *paper prints out* “Error: Database not found.”
???: “I get it you stupid machine!” *paces* “I guess I just need to increase the signal strength.” *mumbles* “Just wiggle that stupid…!” *slams hand on table to the side.* “Bah!” *he examines a wire on the back* “Oh? Why wasn’t this connected?” *plugs wire back in* “Now let's try it.” *puts paper on top of printer attached*
???: *text appears on screen* “Loading… Database found. Connecting…”
???: “Hello? Can anyone hear me?” *places paper on screen* “Stupid…” *mumbles word* “…Network.” 
???: *Text on screen* “Establishing connection to mainframe… Please wait.”
???: “All right.”
Back with Ryker
Ryker: *gets text and checks phone* “Hmm? Someone accessed my records with the old mainframe? How strange…” *types something in the phone*
You get the transfer
???: *text on screen* “Why hello there! Who are you?”
???: *writes something on sheet of paper and scans it in*
???: *response on screen* “No, they just forwarded it to me, seeing as you aren’t from that part of the multiverse. I’m going to come through and talk to you.”
Ryker: *appears in the old, small apartment and sees ???* “Well this isn’t what I was accepting.”
???: *shocked by the person who just appeared* “Who..who are you?”
Ryker: *takes off hand and extends it toward ???* “Ryker. Yours?” 
???: *stares at hand* “Aiolos. Were…you the one who contacted me through the…”
Ryker: *cuts him off* “Yes, yes. I’m a being from the multiverse. What’s so special about you.”
Aiolos: “I’m just a college student. I’m not really anyone interesting. I guess I just hoped…I didn’t think that..” *gestures at Ryker* “…you would appear.”
Ryker: “So…now that you have seen a multiversal being, are you going to come see the multiverse?”
Aiolos: “I didn’t really think this far…” *pauses* “You know what. Yeah. I’ll come with you.” *looks around dusty room* “My life needs an adventure.” *grabs a notebook* 
Ryker: *glances at notebook*
Aiolos: “Just in case I write an autobiography someday.”
Ryker: *raises eyebrows* “Well alright.” *opens portal* “Well come with me…for a…” *glances at notebook and flipilently shakes hand* “New chapter in your life.”
Aiolos: *lets out a sigh* “Alright.” *steps through portal, and enters SOUR* 
Ryker: *flies through after him and closes portal* “So. What do you think.” *leads him into balcony, where a hodgepodge of different styles of architecture connect, and go on for miles*
Aiolos: *jaw drops and leans over balcony and looks around SOUR* “Who…are you?”
Ryker: *smiles* “I call myself the most powerful being in the multiverse. Nothing escapes my notice.”
Aiolos: “But…” *faints*
Ryker: *sighs* “I probably dropped him into it too quickly.” *drops him into a bed in something that looks like his dorm*
Aiolos: *wakes up* “Oh.” *frowns* “That dream felt so real.” *sighs* “Oh well.”
Ryker: *knocks on apartment drawer, in an average human form of himself, standing normally*
Aiolos: *answers door and stares at Ryker* “I…I just had a dream about you.”
Ryker: *stares at him confused* “I’m looking for an Aiolos?”
Aiolos: *shakes head* “Sorry, that's me, yes?”
Ryker: “Come with me.” *walks down hallway back into main SOUR and reverts to his normal self* “It wasn’t a dream.”
???: “ oh this is getting good.” 
Aiolos: “Did I faint? I’m kinda like a goat in that way.” *chuckles* “Sorry, I’m just trying to cope with what’s going on.”
Ryker: “It takes most people a while to get used to this.” *smiles* “How are you handling it?”
Aiolos: *just stares, speechless* “It…I..I can do anything now…anything is at anyone’s fingertips.”
Ryker: *nods* “Indeed.” *smiles* “I give this option to anyone without powers who finds the multiverse.” *pauses for effect and asks conversationally* “If you could have any super power, what would it be?”
Aiolos: “Um…” *stutters* “I…I don’t know.” 
Ryker: “Anything.”
Aiolos: *sighs* “I…don’t know…”
Ryker: “Mind reading, teleporting, shapeshifting, flight. Anything?”
Aiolos: “No.” *frustrated* “At the ONE major point in my life.”
Ryker: “I get it. You feel like if you make a mistake here, it will impact your whole life.”
Aiolos: “I…I think I’ve got it.”
Ryker: “And…?”
Aiolos: “I want the ability to control time.”
Ryker: *nods* “Are you sure?” 
Aiolos: “Yes.”
Ryker: *nods and holds out hands then furrows brow* “It’s not working on you…nothing is…and…all my other powers have been working on you…so you’re not like Snape…odd. It’s like…you’re destined to be this way.”
Aiolos: “Destined for what?”
Ryker: “I…I don’t know… give me time to think.”
Aiolos: “But what should I do?”
Ryker: “Be my guest. Feel free to wander and explore, and meet other people.”
Aiolos: “Oh…okay…?” *wanders off to explore the SHOP or (Sour Hub of People)*
While he walks Aiolos feels like he is being watched.
Aiolos: “Who’s there?” *begins speeding up his pace. He pens in his notebook, “I feel I’m being watched, something seems  off about this utopia…for example…why haven’t I encountered anyone else…”* “Hello?”
???: *giggles.* “ You think it's a utopia. Hu , strange.”
Aiolos: “Who…Who’s there… I…I’ve got a pen!”
???: * giggles again.* “ I’m no one special.” 
Aiolos: *worried* “Why…are you watching me?”
???: “ I watch everyone.” 
Aiolos: “Who…WHO ARE YOU!”
???: “ I’m not important, what is important is you. You have stumbled into this adventure and now you must make a decision.” 
Aiolos: “What…decision…?”
???: “ Well on what you are going to do silly. There are multiple options, you could decide to be boring and oblivious and stay at SOUR and have pleasure and pretend nothing is wrong, or you could go against Ryker and snoop, or you could look for other characters.”
Aiolos: “What are you? A Choose Your Own Adventure book.” *pauses* “Did you just tell me to snoop against a quite powerful being? That seems like a bad idea. “
Scientist: “Hello, I do not think I have seen you before. Would you like a free paradox?”
Aiolos: “Are you the voice?” *looks at Scientist* “You’re not what I expected for a mysterious voice.”
Scientist: *Laughs* “No, I am not the voice, but trust me I am plenty mysterious.”
Aiolos: *raises eyebrows and looks at Scientist* “Well, I wouldn’t think so, but seeing as we’re in the location we are, nothing would surprise me.”
Scientist: “If I am correct I believe that the voice is not who they appear to be.” *mumbles: “I thought THE Author would not do it like this but okay this works.”*
Aiolos: “A voice? Ah yes, it’s appearance must be different. That makes perfect sense.”
Scientist: “I am from Bound, ”
???: * giggles but only Aiolos can hear it.* 
Aiolos: “You heard that, right?”
???: * so Aiolo can only hear.* “ nope.” 
Aiolos: “I wasn’t talking to you.”
???: * so Aiolo can only hear.* “ geez, what’s your problem?” 
Aiolos: “MY PROBLEM! You’re an insulting cocky voice who’s quite rude.”
???: * so only Aiolos can hear.* “ I’m not cocky or insulting. I never did anything like that. I told you that you had to make a choice. “ 
Aiolos: “You’re making me seem insane.” *pauses* “Wait. What if I AM insane! None of this makes sense…so I must be insane! Please! Somebody help! I’m going insane!”
???: * so only Aiolos can hear.* “ You're not going insane. You're actually one of the most sane people here.” 
Aiolos: “Says the voice in my head.”
???: * so only Aiolos can hear.* “ I'm not in your head. I just choose to talk to you only. And you're quite lucky because I don't normally talk to the characters.”
Aiolos: “Yeah, sure. Prove it.”
???: “ alright.” 
What looks like a projection of a girl with a deer skull over her head like a mask appears. She is wearing a green vest and black leggings, and it looks like there are lots of leaves in her hair.
???: * so only Aiolos can hear.* “ My name is Dream.” 
Aiolos: “My brain is quite subtle, isn’t it. I wonder why someone would be called DREAM, when they’re a projection in my head.” 
Dream: “ That's just my name. Look you can keep pretending I’m in your head but I’m still going to talk to you like it or not.” 
Scientist: “How on earth are you communicating, ohhh I see.” *Begins to follow the mental connection to Dream.*
He can’t find anything 
Dream: * disappears and laughs.* “ it’s not that easy to find me.” 
All of a sudden scientist has a mental war with something in his head, the following is what is happening inside of him
Thought scientist: “How on earth are you in here?”
Jake: “Why did you do this to me?”
Thought scientist: “You know why!”
Jake: “If you do not release me then I will have to use other means”
Thought scientist: “How, I will always be more powerful than you.”
Jake: “I am more powerful than I seem” *He says in a voice that seems more like 3 different people*
As he says this Against scientists will, his hand races, and a beam of energy shoots off into a Multiverse very very far away then Jake is back in the piano
Computer: “Finally, I am in a much better body, I am so GLaD that I can now think about space”
Scientist: “Oh be quiet” *Rolls eyes*
Ryker: “So…can I have a copy?”
Scientist: “No” *pause* “Also, how did you get in hear”
Ryker: “I’ll just get a copy myself.” *plugs odd looking flash drive into Computer*
Scientist: “Why did you just copy a computer with The greatest virus ever that will Rick roll the multiverse when it is plugged in?”
Ryker: “So I could have a fail safe…” *thinks he copies GlaDOS‘s data*
Scientist: *thinks to himself:”He does realize that I still do not have a working copy of her right, so far I have only copied her voice engine. I still have not figured out how to transfer anything else.”*
Meanwhile 
Rain: * looks tired.* “ I think my head is cleared up now.” 
Axolotl: *pulls out some odd looking food* “Here. This’ll help you get some of your energy back.”
Radharc: “Did you guys just see that”
As he says this the air around them seems to get colder and dark clouds begin to cover the sky around them
Rae: *sighs in relief.* 
They see an almost 3d shadow down the hall, it looks at them, nods its head and disappears.
Radharc: “WHAT THE” *remembers that there is a child with him* “heck, what in the multiverse was that thing you guys know?”
Axolotl: “A pineapple. How should I know?”
Rain: *eyes lighten.* “ Can I keep it?”
Axolotl: “My pineapple?”
Radharc: “I know who he is. Do not worry he is not here for us, just move on.”
Axolotl: “He’s a pineapple.”
Radharc: “The star only rises at nightfall” *When he says this he disappears and is sent to his pocket dimension.*
Radharc then goes to the control room of his base and begins to shut down some of the entrances into his dimension.
Ryker: *teleports to Radharc* “Hey.”
Radharc: “Welcome to….”
Ryker: “THE UNDERGROUND!”
Radharc: “Nightfall, to be honest I do not know where anything is right now, do you want some hot chocolate”
Ryker: “So. Nightfall. So creative of a name. Why not ISLAN(a)D”
Radharc: “Would you like a tour of Nightfall?”
Ryker: “Of ISLAND? Sure.”
Radharc: “Right this way”
The first room is full of paintings from all over the multivers
These Italics fill you with Determination
Radharc: “I think this room is the art room”
Radharc has the achievement of “ART I think”
Ryker: “Oh. ‘Art’. That’s useful.”
THE Author Achievement Get: Annoying Video Game References
The next room is a room full of control panels.
Radharc: “This monitors random multiverse things, I think, feel free to do whatever you want in here.”
Ryker: “If paradoxes are annoying, then are annoyances paradoxical?” *he says this in a joking tone* *starts pushing random buttons, then summons a copper golem*
Everyone in the multiverse sneezes all at once.
Ryker: “I’m in control now and i refuse to do any punctuation or spelling checks”
The next room is full of paintings of Ryker Hepworth
THE Author: “HOLL UP! NO!”
Present Author: “I really need to revive the 4th wall!”
Ryker: “French fries.”
The next room is full of cutouts of rick astley
rekyR: “I’m a mirror Ryker.” *mumbles* “I’m also a shadow.”
Ryker: “Shut up.” *throws him back to the floor*
Dream: * no one knows but she helps rekyR up and gives him a sympathetic pat pat.* 
rekyR: *dies*
Dream: “ oh.” 
Dream is pushed out of Nightfall and cannot find her way back NO MATTER HOW HARD SHE TRIES, The next room has a pedestal with a book about a man named stanley.
Radharc: “I love that book!”
Ryker: “All right. Whatever.”
Then An alarm goes off and Radharc looks up
Radharc: “I need to go…” *Mumbles: “Stupid reactor 13”*
Ryker: *teleports to Radharc when he leaves*
Radharc: “What is wrong with the reactor now… RYKER, can you hand me the space core” *mumbles:”It is kind of important”*
Ryker: “No.” *eats reactor and space core*
Ryker is then sent to a strange place and is forced to listen to this song that is going to get stuck inside your head, Core 13 is then restored with the space core attached to it.
Ryker: “Meh. I’ve done worse.”
Meanwhile
Scientist: “Where is that fever dream inducer..” “Oh hear it is” *Enters fever dream*
Meanwhile 
Dream: * goes back to Aiolos. As just a voice.* “ Alright, I’m back.” 
Aiolos: “Oh great. The voice in my head is back. I’ve decided to accept my insanity and/or dream. How may I help you?”
Dream: “ well I think you should try and do something exciting. Rykers gone. Or there are MANY other characters.” 
Aiolos: “Characters? What is this? A book? Or a movie?”
Dream: “ neither it’s well…. Never mind.” 
Aiolos: “Oh. Am I just a character in someone else’s story? That would make sense to an insane person such as myself. I will eventually come to terms with my insanity.” *slowly inhales and looks around*”But not right now. I can’t handle any of this.” *gestures out window*
Dream: “ You're not just a character, calm down. It’s more like your a character for me. I've seen many peoples stories played out without them knowing I exist. So it’s not like you're just a character. It’s more like how you’re living an interesting life.” 
Aiolos: “Am I? Or am I going insane? I still don’t have any proof.”
Dream: * a shadow appears on the wall and it grabs the rug under Aiolos and pulled it out causing him to trip.* “ good enough?” 
Aiolos: “That just makes me seem more insane. Shadows don’t pull carpets.”
Dream: “ Alright, suit yourself. You asked for proof.” 
Aiolos: “And that, voice in my head, is not proof.”
Dream: “ Well don’t say I didn’t try.” 
Meanwhile 
Rae: * a timer beeps.* “ Oh, I'll be right back. Just need to check on SOUR.” * teleports away.* 
Meanwhile 
Dream: “ oh I didn’t expect her to be back this early.” 
Scientist has now entered the dream scape
Simon: *enters with a smoke bomb and pulls a bouquet of flowers out of his sleeve* “How are you doing this fine afternoon? I don't know if we’ve met, I’m Simon.”
Scientist: *Follows a path in the dreamscape until he finds Dream.* “Hello, I thought I would introduce myself. My name is Один知るかایٹم nice to meet you.”
Simon: “Well it’s a pleasure to make your acquaintances. I’m simon. I only exist some of the time popping in and out of existence but that means that I can pop in everywhere and help you with what you need.”
Scientist: “How can you hear me, I am in the dream scape. Ohhh, Dream has a communication rig set up.”
Simon: “I literally just said that I can go anywhere I please as long as it is in tune with my abilities and is okay with the AUTHORS”
Scientist: “Ohh, that makes much more sense” *Thinks to himself: “Hopefully he doesn't remember that I sent him to the end of the multiverse once.”*
Simon: “dude i am a magician i can literally read minds (when it’s convenient to the plot) but anyways it looks like radharcs trying to do something so lets get on with it.”
Meanwhile
Radharc: “Where did I put that core!?”
Simon: “Whtat core?”
Simon was then launched out of Nightfall and lost all memory of what happened there
Simon: “I have no idea what nightfall is but I guess I don’t remember it anymore.” *sarcastically* “Thanks alot”
Radharc: “Oops I left the block on let me turn it off” *Turns off block to Simon, Simon is then drawn back to nightfall* “Sorry, I am still working out some bugs in the security system, Welcome to nightfall, How can I help you?”
Simon: “Well I’m just a plot device to get things moving but seeing as neither Ryker nor THE Author are here right now i guess I can just explore this place. Bytheway, what is this place?”
Radharc: “This is my place of operations. Would you like me to give you a tour, it literally changes the layout every day.”
Simon: “Sure but first I want to make another character. I mean, I’m already a very meta character and I want somebody that I can always interact with when people are ignoring me.” *makes a parrot come out of a box* “You can be Eilleen the Bird.(Check character doc)”
Space Core: “SPACE”
Radharc: “I thought I turned that thing off.” *Turns off core*
Space Core: “Looook at all the space gotta have the space I looooove spaaaaaaaaaaace!”
Radharc: *Takes space core and turns it off.*
Eilleen the Bird: “Well at least he’s gone. I could use some space too but maybe not that kind.”
Simon: *sighs*“Still as sarcastic as ever Eilleen”
Ryker: *raises eyebrows* “You would get along well with Axolotl.”
Simon: “Who me or Eilleen?”
Ryker: “Both of you.”
Dream: * pokes Eileen but is invisible so she thinks Simon did it.* 
Who: * appears.* “ hey chicken…..” * stops abruptly when she sees Simon “hu… oh….whoa…who…oh.” * giggles and fans herself.* “ Is it hot in here or is it just him?”
Ryker: “Excuse me. You’re insulting me here.”
Who: “ forget you. Who is HE?!” 
Ryker: “Rude.” *pauses* “And he’s a magician. He doesn’t have a REAL job.”
Who: “ you think I care if he has a job?! I gain wealth with every thing in the multiverse!” 
Ryker: “Well sure, but he’s also cold and distant. He doesn’t talk to people often.”
Who: * ignores Ryker.* “ so what’s your name, handsome?” 
Meanwhile
Aiolos: *continues to wander around hallways, eventually finding a non-conspicuous door* “Oh a door.” *realizes he’s talking to himself* “I guess I’ve reached the next stage of insanity.” *opens door and looks into what appears to be a closet* “A closet? Here? But why?” *pauses* “You don’t think…” *steps into closet, expecting a Narnia-like scenario to unfold, but it doesn’t, and he touches the back wall* “Well. Disappointing.” *walks out of door, just to suddenly realize that he’s wearing entirely different clothing. He looks at the clothes, shocked. He’s wearing poofy, prince-like attire, including a cap with a feather in it. He looks down* “Welp. Definitely insane.”
Dream: “ fancy outfit. Oh incoming.” 
A girl wanders cautiously down the hall. She freezes at the sight of him. She has blond hair, yellow eyes, and a red backpack. 
Aiolos: “Another person to add to my insanity? Oh great. And who are you. Wait. Let me guess. Crazy.”
Rae: “ what? No! I'm very much real. Also you're probably not crazy.” 
Dream: “ That's what I’ve been telling him for HOURS!” 
Rae: * jumps.* “ oh! Umm… hi, who are you?” 
Dream: “ I’m no one important.” 
Aiolos: “Right. All the voices in my head saying I’m not crazy. That’s a good sign.”
Rae: “ I'm not… whatever. You can pretend I’m not real. I’ve got more important things to do. We’re Ryker.” 
Aiolos: “Did that last bit make no sense, or is it just me being insane.”
Simon: “So I heard somebody is being insane? Well that can’t be right.”
Ailos got the achievement: “Welcome to the multiverse”
Aiolos: “Oh great. Another voice in my head.”
Ailos got the achievement: “Another voice in my head!”
Aiolos: “Is anyone else getting random pop ups in the upper right hand corner of their eyes saying stupid things?”
Simon: “Well I sometimes do but I prefer my HUD be turned off.”
Ailos got the achievement: “Stop insulting the achievement system!”
Aiolos: “So, as an insane person, should I just ignore these?”
With the ultimate power that is the achievement system Aiolos is then sent to the tip of the multiverse and is then dropped down back to A2
Simon: “Did you just take advantage of the achievement system? *fondly* “Man, I love cheating.”
Present author: “What are you talking about, you are! YOU SAW NOTHING!” *Simon forgets about what just happened!* “YOU SAW NOTHING!!!!!!!!!!”
xX THE Author Xx: “You be cheating lol. Get rekt. Gg ez.”
Present Author: “YOUR MOM WENT TO COLLEGE!”
THE Author: “Is that an insult?”
Present author: “7”
Author: “ why does it matter if they cheat? If they can manage to get past us they should deserve it.”
Aiolos: *face fills with surety* “You know what? I don’t want this insanity in my life. Leave. All of you. Then I can enjoy my normal life in peace.”
Author: “ It's our story.” 
Dream: “ it’s my reality.”
Rae: “ it’s my home… well kinda.” 
Aiolos: “All right. Girl whose name I don’t know. Prove that I’m not insane. I’m desperate.”
Rae: “ umm ok.” *grabs his arm.* “ I guess because you can feel me you know you're not insane because if I were just insanity you couldn’t feel that. No level of insanity can mimic touch. And three of the voices are the authors. They show up all the time. And the other voice I can hear too so you know they're not a hallucination.”  
Aiolos: “As I did not know the fact that insanity cannot mimic physical touch. I cannot believe any of your sentiments. Go ahead and try again.”
Rae: “ Ask Ryker I guess.” * hmmmm* “ You're not from around here are you?” 
Aiolos: “I have talked to the one you call ‘Ryker.’ He’s the most insane voice in my head. And I am indeed from my brain, so…I am from around here.”
Rae: * makes an odd face.* “ this isn’t your mind. This is the multiverse. And All sorts of odd stuff happens.” 
Aiolos: “That’s a good way to explain the chaos of my brain. ‘The Multiverse.’ I guess that makes a shred of sense to nincompoops such as yourselves. Or I guess myself.”
Rae: “ I’m done with this. Look, I can say anything and you wouldn’t believe me. The only way you’ll understand is if I used my powers on you which I refuse to do. So I’m going to do more important non time wasting things.” * begins to walk away.*
Aiolos: “Since you are the most interesting part of my insanity, I have decided to follow you. This is not up for debate, because, as a voice in my head, you have no real opinion.”
Rae: “ oh yeah? Well let me ask you this. If I’m just a voice in your head couldn’t you control me with your thoughts?” 
Aiolos: “That is an inaccurate statement, seeing as you can’t control the inner part of your mind, like you are most likely from.”
Rae: “ Well I do have an opinion. And I can teleport away, so have fun following.” 
Aiolos: “All right. I guess this part of my insanity is now fleeing. One step closer to curing it.”
Rae: * teleports back to Axolotl and the gang.* “ Ryker can be so annoying, and he’s not even the one who was being odd.”
Axolotl: “Who was? Who else is with Ryker?”
Rae: “ I didn’t catch his name. But I could tell he wasn’t from the multiverse. And now he thinks he’s insane and I’m a hallucination.” 
Axolotl: “How odd. I guess it makes sense.”
Rae: “ yeah.” 
Axolotl: “There isn’t a lot to do here, so I could use some intel on this ‘odd character’”
Rae: “ what… you mean like magic.” 
Axolotl: “Yes. I would like to know his skills, who he sides with, and his basic personality.”
Rae: “ sure you can use magic on him. I can't speak for him but I don't really care if you use your powers on him.”
Simon: “So I get how Radharc isn’t from the multiverse because he does not have a specified world and travels, but how is Aiolos not from the multiverse?”
Simon: “Well I suppose all of this is the multiverse of The Author, so is he from a different one? After all Author has his own multiverse but how did Aiolos travel to this one?”
Rae: “ Well it’s less like he’s not from the multiverse, and rather he knows nothing about the multiverse.” 
Aiolos: “Okay figments of my imagination. Stop referring to things that don’t make any sense. It makes you sound insane. Wait.”
Rae: “ Wait, how do you get here?” 
Aiolos: *looks around* “I…don’t know…”
Axolotl: *waves hand* “I teleported him here for convenience sake.”
Aiolos: “Are…we in Portal? That doesn’t even make any sense.”
Rae: “ we’re not in a portal.” 
Rain: “ is that the character you were talking about.”
Aiolos: “No, the game Portal. With GlaDOS? Are you understanding any of this?”
Rae: “ yep.” 
Aiolos: “Wait. You get what I’m saying?”
Rae: “ yeah that’s just classic multiverse stuff.” 
Aiolos: “Multiverse stuff? Sure…”
Rain: “ you do realize that the multiverse is a concept of  multiple realities all connected together right?”
Aiolos: “Exactly. A concept!”
Rain: * is confused.*
Rae: “ Soooooo how did you get here again?” 
Axolotl: “I teleported him here.”
Rae: “ohhhh.”
Radharc: “Aiolos if you want proof, I can show you what the multiverse is like. Would you like me to?”
Aiolos: “I really don’t think that would prove anything.”
Radharc: “Oh, I can” *He looks at Aiolos says something strange and taps his cain*
A connection between Aiolos forms, A device appears between them and the atoms around them shift and change. Around them a model of the multiverse appears around them all around them the multiverse forms and it looks like they are in the place where the watcher reside except that it is only contains to the room around them
Radharc: “This is the multiverse, some time ago there was only one universe, it was all contained and kept together by a gem”
The seen changes and they are in an ancient temple with a gem in the center
Radharc: “This gem was known as the multiversal gem, It possessed an insanity of power. All was based on one universe. Then a scientific group known as PARROT (Program Against Ryker’s Radical Oppressive Tendencies) found a way to harness the ability of the gem and were able to shatter it into many pieces” 
The gem shatters and the scene changes to a point where the timeline splits it begins to change at many points moving faster and faster
Radharc: “By doing this the time began to split and the multiverse was born”
Aiolos: *nods* “Indeed. That makes sense to an insane person such as me.”
Rae: “ how did you come to think you were insane again?” 
Aiolos: “Look around. How am I NOT insane.”
Rae: “ what are you talking about? This is normal. Plus you can’t be insane if you don’t have a way you became insane.” 
Aiolos: “Ah, yes. It makes sense that we’re in the game Portal. And I became insane obviously, but I don’t know how. I must have cracked under pressure for my finals.” *he shouts* “Somebody please help me! I’m insane! Someone take me to a mental asylum.”
Rae: “ that’s…. Not how it works.” 
Aiolos: “Says the voice in my head.”
Rae: “ you don’t just buckle under pressure. Stress can’t drive you insane. Plus your not responding like an insane person.”
Aiolos: “Well, how do I know I'm not Roaming around screaming random nonsense. And I wouldn’t know, since I have no way to gain evidence, in case I truly am insane.”
Rae: “ because your not.” 
Aiolos: “But how do I know?”
Rae: “ because you’re just talking. And unless you have a real reason on how you became insane, then you can be insane.” 
Aiolos: “I may think I’m just talking, but I really could be spouting nonsense. I may have schizophrenia for all I know.”
Rae: “ That's still not how it works.” 
Aiolos: “Elaborate.”
Rae: “ if you’re really screaming nonsense and not knowing about it that would mean you were unconscious, so you could justify this as a dream. But that wouldn’t be true because you can think therefore you are conscious.” 
Aiolos: “Indeed, I am conscious. Different forms of insanity allow for hallucinations, which I expect are occurring currently. My brain seems to be imprinting thoughts from my subconscious onto the real world, resulting in this.” *waves hands* “This…insanity. Eventually, I am hoping to snap awake from this illusion and never return, however, I don’t believe that I will.”
A loud ticking sensation occurs
Dream: “ ohhhhhh, that sounds promising.” 
Aiolos: “I rest my case.”
Dream: “ oh that’s real.”
Aiolos: “Wait. That sounds…” *he falls on the ground, unconscious*
Dream: “ Someone revive him please.” 
Rain: *look around.* “ What was that?”
Axolotl: *shrugs*
Aiolos: *still unconscious*
A suggestion: Go inside his head.
Rae: “ lol nope.” 
Axolotl: “What do you think’s going on with him?”
Rae: “ I dunno.” 
Rain: * is bored so she gets out an uno deck and begins to sort it by color.* 
Axolotl: “Well I’m going in.” *wavers* “Anyone coming with?”
Rain: “ shure.” 
Axolotl: “Anyone else?”
Rae: “ no thanks.”
Axolotl: “All right then.” *he sprinkles some salt in a circle around Aiolos, then looks at Girl*
Girl: *mutters something, waves her hand and Aiolos begins floating, and a portal opens up beneath him.*
Axolotl: “Are you ready?” *smiles* “Because I’m sure not.” *jumps in* “See you on the other side!”
Rain: * follows.*
In Aiolos’s Head
To set the scene: Aiolos appears to be sleeping in a bed in a small dorm room, with random wires and technology scattered about the room. On one end of the room is a computer, and in a corner, a desk with a load of various papers and a small laptop.
Aiolos: *wakes up to alarm clock and yawns* “Wow! What a dream! I can’t believe that wasn’t real…” *pauses* “But I’m glad it wasn’t.” *he’s talking to the computer* “I dreamt I finally built you.” *frowns* “But…it looks like you’re lifeless. Like always.”
???: *knocks on the door*
Aiolos: “Right. Right. I’ll be out in a bit. I just woke up.” *He begins to change into a hoodie and sweatpants and walks out the door and into the kitchen where ??? is making eggs.*
???: “So how’d you sleep?”
Aiolos: *rubs his eyes to wake up* “I had an odd dream.”
???: “Anything good enough to write about?”
Aiolos: *shrugs* “Maybe. I don’t know.” *puts a pop tart in a toaster* “How about you? Any dreams?”
???: “Nah. But be prepared for tonight’s D&D, it’s a doozy!”
Aiolos: *panicked* “Crap! Tonight? I thought it was next week. I've got some stuff I need to work on.” *he begins shoving some things into his satchel*
???: “What. Your robot? I don’t know when you will find the time to work on the thing.”
Aiolos: *shrugs* “I don’t know. These creative writing classes are pretty easy.” *pop tart pops out of the toaster and Aiolos snatches it and takes a bite out of it.*
???: “Come on man! You’re gonna choose your stupid robot over us? This is the third time this month!”
Aiolos: “Oh fine. But only for you man. Got it?”
???: “Alright. And don’t forget to level up your 
character to level 10. You’ll need it.”
Aiolos: *jokingly* “Well now I’m worried!” *begins to walk out the door*
???: “Hey! Where are ya going?”
Aiolos: *shrugs* “I’m planning on going to the park to think for a bit. That alright with you Gabe?”
Gabe: “Yeah, yeah. Whatever man.” *waves hand* see you tonight right?”
Aiolos: *waves half eaten pop tart at Gabe* “Right.” *He grabs his satchel and begins walking to the park.* “Bye!”
Gabe: “See ya!”
Aiolos: *pulls a pen and notebook out of his backpack and begins scribbling some words down in some illegible handwriting as he walks to the park. He stops, frowns, erases something, writes something else, and then continues walking until he get to a bench where he pulls out his laptop from his satchel and begins typing on it*
Axolotl: *intently watching, waiting for Rain*
Rain: * walks up to him.* “ hi. Wow Gabe? Isn’t he the guy who impersonated a princess? The sack of rice?” 
Dream: “ ohhhhhh. Time to tamper with things!”
Rain: “ hello?”
Dream: “ oh! Geeper!” 
Rain: “ Axolotl, did you hear that?” 
Axolotl: “You mean the voice. Sure. And voice, I wouldn’t recommend tampering with things in here. It’s already a bit dicey. And I’m pretty sure Gabe’s the one who gave Ryker that one card so he can time travel.”
Rain: “ oh.”
Dream: “ awwww.”
Aiolos: *gets up from chair, closes his laptop, and begins walking again until he arrives at a large college classroom. He sits down, and waits for a bit until the teacher arrives, along with other students* “Good morning Professor!”
Professor: “And a good morning to you as well!”
After a while, the class begins and ends. (It was his creative writing class)
Aiolos: *grabs his satchel and begins to leave*
Professor: *also leaving, notices notebook sticking out of satchel* “Oh! What’s that?”
Aiolos: “Oh, just my dream from the other night.”
Professor: *grabs notebook and pages through it.* “My! This is rather intriguing! I'm interested to see the whole story!”
Aiolos: *stutters* “W…well… T..thanks…?”
Professor: “You’re welcome!”
Aiolos: *returns to his apartment and shouts* “Hey Gabe! I’m back!”
Gabe: *setting some things up on a table* “Great! Remember, in about an hour you better be out here!”
Aiolos: “Yeah, yeah, I will.”
Gabe: “Great!”
Aiolos: *walks to his room and sets his satchel down and pulls out his laptop then looks at the computer* “What am I going to do with you?” *he begins grabbing some wires and the computer turns on, and he begins typing on it, checking his laptop every once and a while*
An hour later
Gabe: “The guys are showing up! Get out here!”
Aiolos: *presses enter on his computer and gets up and grabs a sheet of paper and some dice* “I’m coming!”
Three people enter the dorm, so there’s now 5 of them
Gabe: *sitting behind the DM screen* “Are y'all ready?”
Aiolos: “Sure.”
They play D&D for a couple hours and then begin to end
Gabe: “…and you realize that Ryker truly was drunk the whole time!”
The rest of the group: *shocked*
Aiolos: “B…but how?”
Gabe: *begins packing things up* “You’ll just have to see next time!” 
Group *sighs*
??? #1: “Well, see all of you next week!”
Gabe: “Yep! See ya then!”
The other three leave
Gabe: “Well…it’s getting late…and I’ve got a quiz tomorrow…so…G’night!” *he heads off to his room*
Aiolos: “Well good night!” *he also returns to his room and changes into his pajamas, and goes to bed*
Everyone is suddenly forced out of Aiolos’s mind, and he wakes up. The summoning circle is gone.
Aiolos: “Well this is great! I’ll get more stories for the professor!” *he looks at Rain and Rae* “So…are you two cousins? Or..?”
Rain: “ Wait, I thought you didn’t believe in Ryker.” 
Rae: “ nope.” 
Aiolos: “Are you referring to the D&D character or the insane guy?” *turns to Rae* “Then could you explain? Sisters? Friends? Neighbors?”
Rae: “ we’re the same person.” 
Rain: * mutters.* “ stupid Ryker.” 
Aiolos: *pauses for a second* “Elaborate?”
Rae: “ You know about time travel right? Well Ryker looked in one of my memories and decided to mess with the past so he basically kidnapped me when I was 10 and when she did like him for being a psychopath he abandoned her.” 
Rain: *nods.* “ Is this all for your story?” 
Aiolos: “Great…so why?”
Rae: “ Wait what story? I didn’t agree to this being part of a story!” 
Aiolos: *clears throat* “Well, since you’re just a figment of my imagination, I just assumed…”
Rae: * pulls hood over head.* 
Aiolos: “I apologize. May I please write a story about you?”
Rae: “ I’d prefer it if you didn’t. It might not mean much to you but this actually happened to me and some of it wasn’t pleasant.” 
Aiolos: “It may have happened, but wouldn’t you like people to know about the trials you’ve faced?”
Rae: “ people have sent assassins after me. I’m not really the most popular person in the multiverse.” 
Rain: “ WAIT, WHAT?!” 
Aiolos: “Yes, but you’re both the most amazing person I know.”
Rae: “ really? You must not get out much.” 
Aiolos: *sighs* “The most exciting thing in my life before this was D&D every week.”
Rae: “ oh.”
Rain: “ hold up. An ASSASSIN?! I thought the trunk and  K…..” 
Aiolos: *scribbling in his notebook* 
Dream: “ awww poor souls. You still think it’s your fault?” 
Aiolos: “Elaborate.”
Dream: * appears. She looks annoyed at him through her skull mask. Her pure black eyes with two red dots as pupils carving into him. * “ oh now you want my help? Now that you actually think it’s convenient?” 
Aiolos: “Indeed. Is there a problem? As a figment of my imagination, I would think it shouldn’t matter.”
Dream: “ oh so now I’m the only figure of your imagination?!” 
Aiolos: “Nope. Everyone here is!”
Dream: “ Well then figure everything out yourself.” 
Aiolos: “But how?”
Dream: “ yes.” 
Aiolos: “Could someone teleport me to Ryker then, if you won’t give me any information?”
THE Author: “Would I work?”
Author: * teleports Aiolos over a pit of sharks.*
THE Author: *teleports him to Ryker* “Rude.”
Dream: “ he deserved it.” 
Ryker: *sees Aiolos* “Yes?”
Aiolos: *clicks pen* “What can you tell me about yourself and your goals?”
Ryker: “Well…um….I….?”
Aiolos: “Okay, that may be a bit much to understand. What’s your goal at the moment?”
Ryker: *clears throat* “To collect all the shards of the multiversal gem.”
Aiolos: *continues writing* “And what is this ‘multiversal gem’”
Ryker: “It’s a gem that allows someone to alter the entire fabric of the multiverse.”
Aiolos: “Right. So what do you plan to do once you obtain the multiversal gem?”
Ryker: “Uh…to become the king of the multiverse…”
Aiolos: “Right. Anything else I should know?”
Ryker: *shrugs* “Not really.”
Aiolos: “Right then.” *pauses* “Could you teleport me to the portal universe?”
Ryker: “Why?”
Aiolos: *shrugs* “That’s where everyone else is…”
Ryker: “Everyone else?”
Aiolos: “Yeah, you know, the two people that are the same person, the guy in the wizard hat, and someone named Axolotl I think…”
Ryker: *eyes light up* “Really?”
Aiolos: “Yeah…”
Ryker: *teleports them both there* “Hello again.”
Aiolos: “Hi guys…”
Axolotl: “Uh oh. You messed up man.”
Aiolos: “What’d I do?”
Axolotl: “You brought our enemy right to us!”
Aiolos: “Enemy? But Rae is friends with both of you…”
Rae: * is invisible. Teleports back to SOUR.* 
Rain: “ what are you talking about? Rae’s not here she never was.” 
At sour
Rae: * pretends to play her ‘ game’. mind messages Dream.* “ what’s going on?”
Dream: * messages.* “ nothing yet. I’m not sure if we fooled him.” 
Scientist: *appears except he is super pale and looks almost afraid and one of his eyes is twitching* “Excuse me, do you know where Ryker is?”
Scientist then yells and falls down and passes out into another mental breakdown.
Scientist: “How do you keep doing this!?”
UNKNOWN BEING: “We will continue to do this until you let us out. You broke our contract.”
Scientist: “I have captured both of you.”
UNKNOWN BEING: “Yes and no, you have no idea what kind of power you will be attempting to use. There is a reason why there are 3 of us.”
Scientist: “I am more powerful than I seem.” *He wakes up from his dream.*
Simon: “Hiya. What’s going on.” 
Canned laughter when simon appears sitcom style
Rae: “ don't ask me.” 
Dream: * in Raes' head.* “ I think we got him.”
Ryker: "I'm here. And no. You didn’t fool me. I can read Aiolos’s mind.”
Rae: “ dang it.” 
Ryker: *turns to Wiziker* “But you? I’m disappointed.”
Rae: “ leave him alone.” 
Wiziker: *clears throat* “No, he’s right. But…you can’t stop me…”
Ryker: “Yeah sure.”
Wiziker: *hold up gem shard* “I have linked this directly to myself. If you kill me, your precious gem shard is lost.”
Ryker: “Which shard is this one?”
Wiziker: “The one from my own universe.”
Ryker: *raises eyebrows* “Well then. I guess we are at a standstill.”
Wiziker: “Indeed.” *teleports himself, Axolotl, Rain, Mimick, Girl, Snape, Smile, and Hestuia away.*
Ryker: *clears throat* “Now for the rest of you.” *uses mind to drag the entirety of Glados into the room* “Go. Get my shard.” *teleports away*        
Rae: “ No.”
Ryker: *teleports back* “No?” *creates clone of Rae and kills her*
Rae: * teleports away.* 
Ryker: *smiles* “I’m back baby! And there’s no one to stop me.”
Dream: “ oof.” * goes into Rykers mindscape.* “ Hi Rykers.” 
In Ryker’s head
Lazy Ryker: *gagged* 
Good Ryker: *tied up*
Meta Ryker: *typing about Aiolos on a computer*
Hyper Ryker: *eating a chocolate cake*
Bob: *slurps smoothie*
Evil Ryker: *in control*
???: *whispering in Evil Ryker’s ear*
Base Ryker: *thinking intently*
Good Ryker: *squirming* “Unfly bee!”
When scientist wakes up he yells ”The end is near! We will be free once again! TIME WILL BE UNDONE AND COME BACK TOGETHER ONCE MORE!!!!”
Universe Z5.342 explodes because Scientist sneezes
Fate “im baaaaaaaaa
 (inhales) aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaack”
Dream: * walks past and loosens good Rykers ropes.* 
Good Ryker: *breaks free* “Why thank you.” *punches Dream in the face* “Thank you very much.”
As his fist punches her it goes through her head as if she’s not physically there
Dream: “ Well that was rude.”  * punches him back.* 
All Rykers (and Bob) not counting Evil Ryker: *turn their head all the way around, and the whole area gets corrupted and begin walking toward Dream*
Dream: * vanishes.* 
Evil Ryker: *continues to spread corruption through Rykers mind*
???: “Let me take the controls.”
Evil Ryker: *shrugs* “All right…here ya go.”
Dream: * starts messing with stuff. Knocks Evil Ryker unconscious.* 
???: *takes control of the mind.*
Fate: * after reviewing the past events.* “ I have no idea what's going on but i'm gonna kill myself to keep the plot moving. And the eternal cycle must continue.”
*kills himself. The future portion of the archives shuts down until its keeper is returned from the eternal cycle.*
Xin: “ hey y'all”
Time pauses and scientist appears to be battling a being moving between the universe and he wins the battle he then teleports to his piano.
Scientist: *The following message is broadcasted* “BEINGS OF THE MULTIVERSE THE DAY OF ETERNITY HAS BEGUN PREPARE FOR THE FALL OF ALL THINGS THAT ARE KNOWN!”
Time resumes
Radharc:”NO, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO”
He Begins to close all gateways to Nightfall
Scientist: “Let the fall begin!” *Pulls out bubbly, he is now in a suit*
Ryker: *chuckling* “He. He. He. He HE MWAHAHAHAHAHAHA!” *suddenly something begins coming out of Ryker’s mouth, that looks exactly like him, but with warped colors and shades.*
???: *deages Ryker, pauses times, acquires rest of shards, and unpauses time*
Scientist: *Begins to play an erie tune on his piano and a shield forms around him, as he plays a being begins to emerge out of the piano*
???: “Die. The universe's need to be reset, and all variances need to be destroyed.”
Radharc: “YOU IDIOT” *Slaps his forehead* “Do you, a stupid gem, think that this will solve anything!”
???: “Stupid Gem? You CALL ME STUPID!!!” *erases Radharc from existence*
Radharc: “Just no” *Leaves*
Multiversal Gem: “Leave and die. Stay and die. Surrender and die. There’s no escape.”
All of a sudden a being teleports away from Bound and appears in front of him
Multiversal Gem: “Hello Scientist. I’d recommend saving everyone in this universe…or…they’re all dead.”
Scientist: “I will do whatever you would like me to do Master”
Aiolos: *writing story down in the notebook* “So..Multiversal Gem…who are you? What are your goals, your dreams?”
Multiversal Gem: *collapsing the entire reality* “Death. Reset.” *attempts to kill Aiolos, but is unable to*
Aiolos: “Um. Are you trying to kill me? Because that won’t work. Because you are an illusion of my mind. Everyone here is. Watch.”
Scientist: “I have evacuated them, What would you liikkk……” *Begins to have a seizure his eyes begin to flash from red to pale blue over and over then his eyes become an unearthly shade of pale blue*
Aiolos: *begins to fly* “Wait. That worked?” *face starts to change* “You may have been created. But I will destroy you.” *suddenly his face changes, looking…familiar, a character from the beginning. Ryker.*
Ryker: “DIE.” *a blast begins to come from his hands, slowly breaking up the Multiversal gem, and spreading it across space and time* “I must complete the paradox.”
Unknown: “Finally        ” *Time freezes for ALL even those who have the ability to stay out of a pause except for Ryker* “Ryker, I would like to talk to you,” *Points to a table that was not there before* “I have a deal I would like to make with you, but first would you like anything to eat or drink.”
Ryker: “I’m a bit busy at the moment.”
Unknown: “Exactly why I will make this fast, you are a fascinating event, I would like to give you a choice right now, It could change your life forever., but first a little bit about me, I am known as the contractor, but you know me as Jake, The dark one, and Radharc, We are one and the same being when we are together, our goal is to help those who truly want to help the good of all, recently that fool known as Scientist, got a hold of a spell to take our power and to be able to wright contracts, It did not go how he thought it would and now we are apart of his mind but, we were able to take control of him because he broke our contract, and we were able to punish him by taking full control of him whenever it suits us. Our power is  to create contracts that not no one can break so with this power we are able to give people power. What we would like you to do is once you complete the paradox, we want you to kill scientists, we will be free, and we can once again break apart. If you do this we will do anything you want for you. Will you do it?”
Ryker: *busy so he is ignoring them teleports to the beginning of time and wipes his mind*  
Unknown: “I see, should I interpret this as a no?”
Axolotl: “Yes. That's no idiot.”
Unknown: “Ohh, it's you, I thought you would have learned your lesson by now, shall I reveal to the others?” *Unknown then breaks apart into the 3 beings again and they are all sent to different parts of the multiverse*
THE Author: “I wanted the last text in the first part of this =P.”
