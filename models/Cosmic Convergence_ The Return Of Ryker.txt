Cosmic Convergence: The Return of Ryker
Part 4 of Cosmic Convergence Begins Here:
In a Universe far from our story a being wakes up, As of this moment nothing in all of the multiverses will ever be the same..
Inbetween
Cancer:*turns head, frowns*”something awakens”
Prophet:*waddles out from behind a rock.*”aye. It sings a strange song”
Cancer:”I fear that may be. I will send a messenger to see”
Prophet:”be careful, it may be able to get access”
Cancer:”I will”*begins altering the landscape around the abyss*
SOUR
Ryker: “Who are you?!”
???: *looks around* “Oh…right…SOUR. All right. This isn’t what I expected.” *looks at Ryker* “Crap! How are you here...oh wait.”
Ryker: *blinks* “That was…quite sporadic.”
???: *unveils hood to see a woman with black hair and blue eyes* “Thank you for that. You should probably call all of your friends here. You’ll all die otherwise.”
Inbetween
Cancer:*summons a ruby hawk*”go to the disturbance, I wish to know what has awakened*
Messenger hawk:*begins flying, breaks the sound barrier, stops outside of [insert location] where the disturbance is coming from. Cancer watches*
SOUR
Ryker: “That…may be a good idea…” *mind-messages literally everyone in the roleplay* “Um…get to SOUR any way you can…”
Cancer:*sends black cat*
Cat(Cancer): ”What is wrong. Is it the disturbance?”
Ryker: “Just come to SOUR, I can explain when you get here.”
Cat(Cancer):”I do not wish to leave the inbetween behind. Will it destroy the inbetween?”
Ryker: “Yes.” *looks at ???* “Right?”
???: It’ll destroy everything.”
Cat(Cancer):”okay… I will come”
Cancer:*appears in abyss form. Has a rams head*”what do you wish to explain?”
Prophet:*comes out from behind cancer*”I can’t see anything here.”*runs into wall*
Ryker: “Essentially, Ryker, the one I was…is somehow back…and is ‘archiving the multiverse.’” *looks at ???* “And then she showed up.”
Simon: *goes to sour apparently*
Cancer:”this is concerning”*the inbetween seems to vanish from existence, the rams head begins glowing dimly and shifts to a gem state*
Ryker: “And great…” *suddenly a small shake occurs in SOUR* “Sorry, that’ll happen a lot here. SOUR’s linked to many different universes, so I have to shift when they get destroyed.”
Cancer:”That is okay. It took me a while to make the inbetween not link to everything, to just flow inbetween.”*grins*
Ryker: “Yeah, if you want an unstable universe, go ahead and do that.”
Cancer:”the inbetween is very unstable, but i can usually make it so that it doesn’t seem unstable”
Ryker: “But now it’s one of the first things to go. What does that tell you.”
Cancer:”it isn’t. I have essentially stored it in the ram’s skull”
Ryker: “All right…” *flinches* “All right…we just lost all of X-Z.”
Cancer:”hmm. We will have to get reflections stored in something, otherwise dream, and everyone else in it will die.”
Ryker: “I told them to come…I can do this…” *flinches* “W-” *eye shifts and he squints, bites his lip then says…* “All right…I attached Reflections to SOUR, it should be safe…for now.”
Cancer:”as long as he doesn’t directly attack it, it should be mostly safe, yes?”
Ryker: “He’s not attacking them…he just ‘archives’ them… I think the process is automatic.”
Cancer:”Okay… but if they are archived, then why are they ‘destroyed’.”
Ryker: “I don’t really know…all I know is that universes are being destroyed. And it appears to be beginning with less used ones.”
Cancer:”i wonder if the more used ones have more, like, data or something to erase/archive”*begins making a gem chain out of black diamonds, wraps it around the ram’s horns and makes it into a necklace*
Radharc is in a meeting room in the new nightfall. 
Radharc: “Counsel I have called you in here today to give you some bad news, this news can not be overheard by any one. I will now share is” *Switches to a different language* “я makemake نہیں L我...” *Shutters* “L我21, :::::, I evah 二 sk5私たち”
Gem Raven:*is sitting on Aite’s shoulder, cocks head*
Aite: “We must prepare, begin sequence 25RZX”
Radharc: “Good, remember” *Sends mental message to Aite: “[REDACTED]... Oh yes could you also make sure [REDACTED] does not [REDACTED], also [REDACTED] will not be to happy about [REDACTED]”* *Begins Coughing*
Aite: “Yes”
Gem Raven:*caws*”sick connor man”*caws again*
Radharc: “No, it is just dusty in here.”
Gem Raven:*caws* “doubtful”*caws*
A sudden CRASH can be heard.
Ryker: “Welp. There goes M-V. You should probably explain your plan.”
Radharc: *Comes walking out* “What on earth was that?”
Ryker: “Me losing half of the connection ports.”
Radharc: “Why did you do that?” *Cough* “I thought that we needed those?”
Ryker: “You kinda do.”
Radharc: “Were you the one who cut the ties?” *Cough and mumbles: “Cár chuir mé mo leigheas?”* 
Cancer:”you’ve been coughing a lot, are you o.k.?”
Ryker: “Why would I cut ties I didn’t have to?”
Radharc: “Yah, sorry I forgot to take my cough medication” *Opens box and takes it.*
Cancer:”ok… I don’t really think that-”
Radharc: “No, I am fine, I just have minor allergies. Speaking of which I need to grab something really quick” *Briefly opens doorway, travels through then comes back with a briefcase with an extremely complex lock.*
???: “If you guys want to live…I’d recommend gathering the rest of your peers. Or y’all will lose your lives.”
Cancer:”ok… Radharc, you’ve been very defensive about your coughing”*Pulls Rae into SOUR*
Radharc: “I need to get one more thing” *Brings briefcase with him through the door and puts a few electronics in it.* “Where is that [REDACTED]” *Pauses and finds it, then puts it in the briefcase.*
Cancer:”what does that do?”
Radharc: “They are just some things that I had in other places besides bound, I just needed to grab them, I was slightly concerned about them when I overheard some stuff”
In new Nightfall
Radharc: *Puts briefcase in his room* “Tá brón orm.” *Pauses* “I must go now.” *returns to main area* “That is…” *Coughs* “all I had that survived put away” *Coughs* “Does anyone dust in here?” *Taps cain*
All of the dust in SOUR disappears
Radharc: “That is better.”
Ryker: “The dust sensors! No!”
Jeffrey: “Reactor Explosion imminent. Please stand by. Disarming in 2 minutes. Shutting reactor down. Done.”
Radharc:”Opps, I forgot SOUR uses a dust reactor.”
Ryker: “Thanks for that.”
Radharc: “Your welcome”
Dream: * appears with Arson.* “ yes? I was just about to beat Arson in cards.”
Arson: * mumbles something.* 
Cancer:”the Multiverse is getting ‘archived’ by the old ryker. Dream, i think you mean with a stick, not cards”*grins and puts necklace on*
Dream: “ nope. We were playing trash.” 
Arson: * mutters.* “ stupid game.” * suddenly begins to stare off into space, muttering stuff.*
Dream: “ Anyway, what do you mean ‘ archived’ and E Ryker or the first Ryker?”
Cancer:”The first ryker, and he is ‘archiving’ universes. Basically, he is destroying universes, according to small ryker. But also archiving. It’s very weird.”
Dream: “ ohhhhhhhh.”
Arson: * continues muttering.*  
Cancer:”are you going nuts arson?”
Arson: * looks at her in confusion like he didn’t hear what she said.* “ what? Sorry I wasn't paying attention, something about Ryker?” 
Cancer:”original ryker is ‘archiving’ universes, but really destroying them according to little ryker.”
Arson: “ oh nice.” * goes back to staring off into space and muttering.*
Dream: “ Are you good?”
Arson: * does not answer.* 
Cancer:”I think that being separated from ryker is doing something. He is kind of losing it, and with the universes being destroyed, it could be affecting him as well.”
Arson: * shakes his head.* “ my mind is fine! I uhhh just have something to think about.” 
Cancer:”you seem really out of it.“
Arson: “ i just…” * stares off again.* 
Cancer:”you don’t seem to be able to focus, hey spooky lady, is this normal?”
Dream: “ do you mean me?” 
Cancer:”no, the mysterious lady over there, with the black hair and blue eyes. She’s the one telling us to come here or die.”
Arson: * suddenly* “ NO! I WON’T-” * grabs his head in pain.* 
Cancer:”i think that the others are talking to him.”
Dream: “ i don't think so.”
Arson: * shudders and mutters something else.* 
Cancer:”then what could it be? Ryker?”
Dream: * shrugs.* 
Cancer:”I think that it might be the original ryker, because he now has connections with arson.”
Arson: * pulls hood over his head. He looks really nervous.* 
Cancer:”somethings coming…”
Prophet:”He sings a weird song”
Dream: “ Arson, what's wrong?”
Arson: * mutters* “ no.” 
Cancer:”you need to tell us what is coming, SOUR may be on the line.”
Arson: * winces in pain.* “ no.”
Cancer:”Someone’s torturing him”
Dream: “ oof, that's rough.”
Arson: * wimpers.* 
Cancer:”Well I think that we need to get into his mind.”
In Nightfall
Jaeger: *Goes to SOUR*
In SOUR
Jaeger: “What is going on here?”
Radharc: “Jaeger, I need you to come with me.” *Begins walking* “When Jeffrey rebuilt Nightfall, well it is easier to show you.” *Goes over to computer and begins typing in a strange code.*
A door opens up and Radharc and Jaeger are looking at the room that Ax21 was in.
Radharc: “Somehow he managed to copy off, this room including this” *Holds up USB* “Do you recognize this?” *Pauses for a response*
Jaeger:*Frowns* “No I don’t believe I do.”
Cancer:*watches*
Radharc: “This USB could be the thing that saves us or kills us all. This is a backup of someone very important. This person is Marx Allied Moonlark. I made a backup of it when I herd Scientist say his name in his last spell. This being, who ever he is, is very important, in the coming days, he could be very useful, I know ryker is planning something and it is not good, if I do not make it, I want you to open the briefcase and read the instructions, it has to be you that opens it, I asked a favor from a friend, only 3 people can open it, and 2 of them are right here.”
Jaeger: *takes briefcase* “Who is the third?”
Radharc: *Chuckles* “You will know soon enough, I would prefer for you to not tell anyone about this.”
Jaeger: “I will not, and Cancer, Radharc has probably stopped you from watching.”
Radharc: “Trust me, no other living being would be able to even try to see anything in here, Connor and Ax21Rad were the only ones.”
Jaeger: “Where should we go next, considering your possible demise.”
Radharc: “You will want to stay here trust me, it is about to get really rough. When an elder dies, the world tends to break. But do not worry, I do not plan to die anytime soon.”
Jaeger: “I will stay here and not tell anyone, unless it is dire, I will try not to leave Nightfall.”
Radharc: “Good”
Back at SOUR
Cancer:”Well they went through a door and left, and now we have to figure out what is going on with Arson.”
Dream: “ Well what do we do?”
Arson: * mutters* “ nothing.” 
Cancer:”and why would we do nothing”
Arson: “ because what can you do?”
Cancer:”well you telling us what's going on in your head, for starters”
Arson: * shudders.* “ no.” 
Cancer:”Well then you are making it harder for us to figure out what is going on in your head.”*sighs*”being separate from ryker while everything collapses might be what's wrong, because dream has a physical counterpart.”
Dream: “ No, I highly doubt that. I've been separated from Eve before and I felt fine.” 
Arson: * mumbles something.* 
Cancer:”well speak up”
Arson: * mumbles something else.* 
Cancer:”Speak up”
Arson: * shakes his head and mumbles something.* 
Cancer:*gets head very close, is still big dragon, so it’s kind of intimidating*
Arson: * doesn't care because he doesn't fear her.*
Cancer:”well?”
Arson: * looks like he’s about to say something but then winces in pain and stays quiet.* 
???: *watching conversation with intrigue. Pulls up a device from her pocket* “Readings say that Arson's fine being separated from Ryker, Cancer.” *clears throat* “I haven’t said my name yet, have I? It’s Lyra. Pleasure to meet you all. I’ve idolized you all since I began reading..” *pauses* “Oh never mind.”
Ryker: “What’s that supposed to mean?”
Lyra: *chuckles* “You’ll see soon enough. It was interesting my first time too.” *looks around* “If we want you all to survive…you have to come through here.” *She pulls out a small pair of scissors and opens an odd looking portal. It’s…different…not like other ones you’ve seen. It seems like a tear, rather than a hole.* “Now who’s first?” *she then looks off into the distance* “Oh, also! Nice to meet you.”
Dream: * goes through portal.*
Arson: * begins to follow but then grabs his head in pain.* 
Ryker: *sighs Then attempts to walk through but is prevented.*
Lyra: “I was afraid of that. Some people won’t be able to pass through. I think it has something to do with their relevance to the plot.”
Ryker: “Are you saying I’m stuck here?”
Arson: * begins starting off into space again and muttering.*  
Lyra: “Yes Ryker, I apologize, but I don’t really sympathize with your story either.”
Ryker: “IS THIS YOUR FAULT?”
Lyra: *shakes head* “I’m sorry.”
Cancer:”won’t ryker die, or what will happen, because you said that everyone would die.”
Lyra: “He will be archived.”
Cancer:”archived, according to little ryker here is destroyed “
Arson: * runs at the portal.*
Goes through
Ryker: “Go without me.”
Arson: * goes back though.* “ no.” 
Cancer:”it is going to be very weird without small ryker.”
Ryker: *frowns* “You’ll find me. You just have to make him remember.”
Cancer:”Well who’s ‘him’?”
Arson: “ I don’t want to leave without you.” 
Ryker: “Ryker.”
Cancer:”okay…”
Ryker: “You have to Arson, you’ll be…all right…hopefully.”
Arson: “ but if you die, I die!” 
Cancer:*sits down and looks at them all*
Lyra: “You won’t die Arson, because Ryker won’t die.”
Arson: * looks at her.* “ Do you promise?” 
Lyra: “Yes. Either way, you’d ‘die’ in your scenario, but if I’m right, this is safer for you.”
Cancer:”that sucks hard”
Ryker: *looks at Cancer and Arson* “What are you two waiting for? Go.”
Arson: * looks at him in pain.* “ -ok.” * runs at the portal then trips through it.* 
Cancer*looks back at them*
Ryker: “Cancer, GO!”
Cancer:”ok…”*changes into human form, the necklace shrinks with her, and she walks through.*
Rae: * appears with William. She runs through portal.*
William: * follows.* 
Ryker: *frowns* “Bye Ra-“ *sighs*
Wiziker: *appears* “Welp, I guess this is it. See ya Ryker.” *attempts to walk through portal but fails* “Yep. That was expected.”
Ryker: *begins to chuckle* “If I’m going down, it’ll be nice to have a friend at my side.”
Suddenly, a siren goes off
Ryker: “Only A is left. I’m teleporting everyone through. That alright with you Lyra?”
Lyra: “Of course Ryker.”
Everyone else passes through the portal seamlessly without a problem (save a few like Scientist, E Ryker [insert characters you’re done with here])
Ryker: Welp, I guess this is it. Goodbye Lyra.”
Lyra: “Goodbye Ryker, it was a pleasure meeting you.”
She steps through the portal.
THE Author: “Ha ha! See ya sucker!”
Ryker: “Right back at ya nerd.” *snaps, and ends all life in the remaining multiverse*
Through the portal (Or the personalized portals)
Arson
Arson: * screams in pain.* 
???: * a voice in Arsons head.* “ WHY DID YOU DO THAT!!!”
Arson: * mutters.* “ I had to.” 
Arson stands in a crowd of whispering cloaked figures of all different sizes all whispering stuff like “It worked”
Arson: * starts to get up but pain fills his head and he stays down* 
???: “ we’re not done yet!”  
A figure attempts to lift up Arson to his feet
Arson: * stands but winces.* 
All of them lift their hoods, simultaneously…they’re all…Ryker?
Arson: * looks around in confusion. Freaked out.* “ wha- how?!” 
Ryker?: “HiagainArsonItsnicetoseeyouitsmehyper.”
Arson: “ Hyper? Where are we?”
Hyper Ryker: “InsideRykersmindsilly,itgotcrowdedagainsomehow.”
Arson: “ But how am I here?” 
Good Ryker: “That’s a good question.”
A Ryker stands on a small podium
The Ryker: “Hello newcomers. Welcome to reality. I’m in control here.”
Arson: * mutters.* “ thanks.” * mutters something else.* 
Bob: *slurps smoothie*
Arson: * suddenly looks mad.* “ NO! YOU CANT M-“ * screams in pain.* 
Good Ryker: “I’m sorry.”
Arson: * shakes his head.* “ I’m not talking to y-“ * winces in pain.*
Meta Ryker: “What is pain? A word in a doc? Sigh.”
Pirate Ryker: “Yarrrrrgh!”
 Cancer 
a sunny green plain with a village nearby and a lake that looks like it sinks into an abyss
Cancer:*looks around, the area seems familiar*
There looks like another Cancer in front of the abyss
Cancer:”What are you doing here? You are silent”
Other Cancer:”no I’m not, I am very much singing and well”
Cancer:”no, you are inanimate.”
Other Cancer:”I am, but I can still have thoughts”
Cancer:”no, you can’t. I made it so you couldn’t.”
Other Cancer:”well obviously I can here, in this place.”
Cancer:”Are we going to repeat this again?”
Other Cancer:”I would rather not.”
Cancer:”well I think that we’re going to have to.”
Other Cancer:”no, we don’t”
Cancer:*walks towards the village*
Other Cancer:”well aren’t you going to do something?”
Cancer:”no Trisky, you are silent and will stay forever silent”
Radharc
Radharc: “NO! I can not go back, no, no!” *A small device begins to ring*
On the phone
Radharc: “Hello”
???: “Hello”
Radharc: “Who are you?”
???: “You know who I am”
Radharc: “Yes, I know”
Jake
Jake: “NO” *looks around and realizes no one can see him looks at watch* “Good he is still alive, wait how am I here” *Pauses* “Wait, I forgot I can do that” *Raises hand and begins to build a small device*
Radharc
Radharc: “Where is this place?”
???: *appears behind him* “Think, where else would we be?”
Radharc: “I mean, this is not the worst place I have been.”
Jake
Jake: “Done” *Holds up the device* “Now tell me where I am”
Device: “You are currently in a strange form, from what I have been able to tell the Lyra being somehow pushed your mindscape into a strange being, though the good news is that the briefcase survived so I am still here”
Jake: “I need to get to the others, how would I do that”
Device: “If you can save up enough power, you might be able to boot me just enough for me to send reconnect to the Annex device.”
Jake: “Are there any other beings like me here?”
Ryker: “Oh we don’t do Redacted here.” *fixes it*
Device: “Yes…”
Jake: “YOU! Oh and yes, I will leave this trap, and trust me, no matter how long you keep me here, I will find a way out, I have all of the time I need.” *Closes his eyes and begins to meditate*
Radharc
Radharc: “So, do you know any way for me to get to him?”
???: “I have already tried, the entire door system is still there, but I can not open a waypoint”
Radharc: “Wait, are you thinking what I am”
???: “Well yes of course I am, do you think he knows?”
Radharc: “I am sure of it.”
Ryker: “I know everything!”
Radharc: “Well yes, but we already know that.”
???: “I feel like I know you? Who are you”
Radharc: “That is ryker”
???: “Wow, it has been a long time.”
Ryker: *chuckles* “You don’t know me at all.”
???: “Trust us, we have seen people like you all of the time, all this is, this whatever you want to call it, is just a more complex form of the same story, maybe slightly different people, but still ”
Ryker: “Same story? My friend, this is not your puny tutorial. This is an entirely different story.”
???: “He has no Idea.”
Radharc: “Yes, he still has not made the connection yet. Though soon enough he will hopefully know.”
???: “How long do have?”
Radharc: “From my estimation, anywhere from an hour-2days.”
Ryker: “I know everything. There is no multiversal gem.”
???: “Yes you may, but that does not mean you take the time or effort to make the right connections. This universe, well, you will know one day I hope.”
Ryker: “Universe? I rule the multiverse buddy.”
???: *Chuckles* “One day. I do not know how long I have left so I am going to enjoy myself.”
Ryker: “I don’t have time for this imbecile.” *vanishes* “And good luck trying to get to the rest of the team.”
Radharc: “I am starting to doubt that he will ever know.”
Jaeger
Jaeger: “Why am I floating through the multiverse again?” 
Other Jaeger: “What do you mean again?”
Jaeger: “Dang it, guess this is what that portal did.”
Other Jaeger: “What portal?”
Jaeger: *Explains the events that would happen*
Other Jaeger: “And you think that we are going to be stuck here?”
Jaeger: “Yes.”
Other Jaeger: “So what you are saying is that we are going to be floating forever with only each other to ‘talk’ to?” 
Jaeger: “Yes, want to play chess or another game in our head until our brains go inactive from boredom?”
Other Jaeger: “Sure it will be the first time I have played a game with someone in 10000 years.”
Ryker: *pops in* “Oh I play chess all the tiiiiiiiime with myself.”
Jaeger: “Ryker, what are you doing here?”
Ryker: “Well you guys are the first show with 5 star rating for yeeeeears.”
Other Jaeger: “Is this that Ryker guy you told me about?”
Jaeger: “Yes, apparently he is bored so he is watching us, E4, your move.”
Ryker: “E4? What chess are YOU playing?”
Jaeger: “Just some 4d chess, and Also if this is a test I was patient enough to wait a millenia so……… yeah.”
Ryker: “I’m just waiting for everyone to try and group up again so I can send you on a quest for my enjoyment pleasure…and the viewers of course.”
Jaeger: “You do realize I was stuck here for so long because I could not do anything, right? So if you want us to regroup you are probably going to have to give me some kind of push or get other people to come get me.”
Ryker: “I think Jake and Radharc are working on that as we speak.”
Other Jaeger: “Wait, does that mean everyone has split personalities now? Because now there are two of the same people.”
Jaeger: “I have no idea but until Jake’s and Radharc’s plan is done. Let us continue our game of chess, Check.”
Ryker: “I feel bad for Dream.”
Jaeger: “Why? Checkmate.”
Ryker: “It’s hard enough with two people in your head. Try 4. Or for that case…7.6 trillion. I’m quite exclusive.”
Other Jaeger: “How did you checkmate me so fast?!”
Jaeger:”But dream has practice with different personalities. I got bored while floating so I calculated every outcome a game of chess could have and am really good now.”
Cancer
They are almost to the village 
Cancer:”Ryker is jumping around…”
Trisky:”how do you know”
Cancer:”I’ve always been able to feel things”
Trisky:”one of the many things that you hide from me”
Cancer:”no, one of the many things that you never noticed.”
They get to the village
Ryker: “How’d’y’do, ladies?” *tips hat*
Cancer:*sigh*”Yes, Ryker, what do you want?
Trisky:”Your name’s ryker?”
Ryker: “Yep.”
Trisky:”oh cool! Can you do lots of cool stuff?”
Cancer:*back hands Trisky*”quit making a fool of yourself. You always do this and it always backfires.”
Trisky:*rubbing face*”no it doesn’t “
Cancer:”mmhm, like all the times you tried to get me to do what you wanted, doesn’t work. You think that you have so much power, but all of that power is wasted if you can’t see what is in front of you and pick up on the hints.”
Trisky:*glares*”You always say this.”
Cancer:”yes, I do.” *sighs* “Kay, ryker, what do you want?”
Ryker: “To entertain my viewers.”
Cancer:”ok… we’ll where are your viewers, because the only viewers that I see are the village folk.
They are surrounded by the village folk watching them
Trisky:*freaks out, changes, lights everything on fire, and runs off*
Cancer:*summons a lot of water, changes and follows Trisky*
Rae
Rae: * looks around* “ William?”
Ryker; *transforms into William, and appears behind her, mimics his voice* “Rae?”
Rae: “ oh hey William. “ * sighs in relief.* 
Ryker: “Hey…where’s everyone else?”
Rae: “ I don’t know.” 
Ryker: “What do you think happened to them?”
Rae: “ At this point, I’m not sure.”
Ryker: “So what do we do? Stick to the plan?” 
Rae: * nods. She sits cross legged on the ground then looks at him.* 
Dream
Dream: “ ok can someone..” * realizes she’s alone.* “ oh. Got any advice Eve”
Evelin: “ no not really”
Dream: “ alright you’ve made the mistake of putting me in charge. Let’s explore.” * does so.* 
They’re…in Reflections I guess?
Dream: “ Reflections?” 
Evelin: “ You should look for everyone.”
Dream: “ alright.” * touches rock. Suddenly jerks back.* “ this doesn’t feel right.”
Evelin: “ What do you mean?” 
Dream: “ this isn’t Reflections.” 
William
William: * looks around.* “ Rae?” 
Ryker: *transforms into Rae, and appears behind him, mimics Rae’s voice* “William?”
William: “ oh Rae. You scared me.”
Ryker: “Sorry!”
William: “ It's fine. What do we do now? Stick to the plan?” 
Ryker: “I guess. Where is everyone?”
William: * gives him a curious look.* “ uhh I don’t know.” * looks at him suspiciously.*
Ryker: *looks back, confused*
William: “ hmmm I wonder.”
Ryker: *sits cross legged on the ground, then looks at him*
William: * steps back suspiciously.* 
Ryker: “Are we not…”
William: “ You're not Rae are you?” 
Ryker: *returns to normal* “How’d ya figure it out?”
William: “ You don’t act very much like Rae.”
Ryker: “I was copying her every move though.”
William: “ I can still tell the difference.”
Ryker: “What’s this plan of yours anyway?” 
William: “ I can’t tell you that.” * He looks like he is concentrating on something.* 
Ryker: “You do understand I’m much more capable of getting what I want than he ever was. So don’t avoid the question, or you die. It wouldn’t even lower ratings. You aren’t that interesting.”
William: “ oof. Maybe I won’t tell you.”  
Ryker: “Then die.” *prepares to snap*
William: * suddenly disappears.* 
Ryker: *sighs* “He called my bluff.”
Lottie Darcy
Lottie Darcy: * is asleep.* 
Jake
Jake: “How much power will you need to leap?”
Device: “About 1020.43 ampere”
Jake: “Wow this is going to be sketchy” *Turns knob on the device he made*
Device: “It will take approximately 10 milliseconds to locate the mettle, 4 milliseconds to locate the core, and 20 milliseconds to locate them.”
Jake: “Start.”
The device then locates the elements
Jake: “They are closer than I thought.”*flips a switch and the materials get ripped out of the ground* “This is going to take some time” *Begins to put the device together.*
Device: “There is a being within 10 miles of you”
Jake: “Does he know I am here?”
Device: “No”
Jake: “I think I can get the reactor finished by the time he notices us.” *Pauses* “Well I better get started this is going to be a while”
The device takes about 5 minutes to build
Jake: “That was so long!” *presses button on device and it starts up* “How long will it take to charge?”
Device: “This should give off enough energy to let me jump us about to homing device 2”
Jake: “I guess we are heading to {Author Hidden}”
THE Author: “Ya know, Ryker is like, all powerful now so….you can’t just redact stuff anymore.”The Editor: “Then does he know about me?”
Present Author: “But where is the suspense if you know so soon?”
THE Author: “Yes, and if you don’t want to spoil it, just email it to him.”
Jake: “Time to head to the border.” *begins to walk*
A while later…
Jake: “This is taking longer the I thought”
Device: “We are almost there, approximately 0.2 miles left.”
Jake: *Jogs to the edge of a cliff that seems inpassible*
A random sign “Rheppy29 waz here.” The text appears blocky.
Jake: “Oh boy.” *Holds up device* “This is my least favorite part” *The device connects and a loud cracking sound can be heard from far off*
Device: “The reactor is about to destabilize, we need to jump now”
Jake: “We are so close just a little more power”
The computer then dings and a strange rumble comes from far off
Jake: “NOW” *He Jumps off of the cliff*
The device then sends a large blast of energy to the bottom of the cliff face.
Jake: “Just a little more”
A large split in the air formed and he goes threw it
Jake: “YES! It worked, I knew there would be a way.” *He then walks down the tunnel and appears at… TO BE CONTINUED*
Cancer The Editor: “I see…”
Cancer:*stops chasing trisky*”something is searching, interesting.”
Trisky:*continues running*
Cancer:*absorbs trisky a second time, changing her into the sword again. It takes up less space this time.*”hmm. I think I have learned. That is good, stagnation is bad. Now to find the duplicates.”
Later in the abyss 
Cancer:*is watching Other Cancer and Other Trisky swim around. She shows herself*
Other Cancer and Other Trisky:*looks at here*
Together”wow, who are you? You look just like us!!”
Cancer:”I am you.”*raises hand and absorbs them into her gemheart, just like Original Trisky.
She now has essentially three swords that she can manipulate
Cancer:”Time to find more power wielders”*begins searching the universe/multiverse thing that she is in”
She finds 12 more power wielders and absorbs them
Jake
He then appears next Jaeger
Jaeger: “Welcome to my Purgatory, I only had to wait 100000 years this time.”
Jake: “Radharc is still alive. Do you still have the briefcase?”
Jaeger: *Brings it up* “Yes, you do not know how many times the other Jaeger wanted to open it.”
Jake: “Good thing he didn’t, it is designed to destroy itself if it is opened early.  Also, I should Probably introduce myself, I am Jake, I am one of Radharc’s friends. I am also the one who built that lock on it.” *pauses* “Wait, who are you? I know your name, but I know nothing about you.”
Jaeger: “I am Jaeger. I was Exiled from my previous reality for being a hero, and that is why I have been floating here for several millennia. I know about you because Ryker told me.” *Also explains powerset*
Dream
Dream: “ I think I can find everyone else.” * teleports to Jake and Jaeger.* “ whoa. That was unexpected.* 
Ryker: *floating on his back* “Hey. Nice to see y’all again. What are ya waiting for, gather the rest of the group.”
Dream: “ I guess.” 
Cancer
Cancer:*appears*”I don’t think that I’ve met jake.”
Dream: “ yes you have. He was one of the first characters you met.” 
Ryker: “The series didn’t even start to get good until Rae joined though. That’s when viewership went WAY up.”
Dream: “ yeah that’s why I said ‘ one of the first’.” 
Jaeger: “Is everyone just joining me floating in the nothingness. Because if none of you know how to get out of here we are, in fact, stuck.”
Ryker: “Don’t worry about it.”
Jaeger: “Alright then, now to wait for everyone to get here. We can’t really do much here.”
Dream: “ So we need Rae, William, and Arson.”
Jaeger: “I hope you guys had an interesting time with your other selves. Me and other Jaeger were just floating here for 100000 years. If you are wondering how it has been 100000 years for me and not you, it is because time flows very fast here.”
Ryker: “Oh, Arson’s here.”
Jaeger: “Good, we only need 2 more. Why did we choose this nothingness to meet up at?”
Cancer:”because it was the easiest to get to, and Jake came here as well. I absorbed all my duplicates”
Rae: * appears and punches Ryker in the face.* “ You make a very lousy William.”
Ryker: *avoids punch* “Thank you for that…now I wish that I didn’t ask THE Author to include me in the story. You all were just fine by yourselves.”
Cancer:*laughs*”You don’t mimik people very well.”
Dream: * laughs.* “ I'd like to see you do better.” 
Jaeger: “Welcome to nothingness, everyone now that we are here, Ryker, why did you want us here?”
Ryker: “Oh well that’s easy, I want a new season of my series, so I needed to prompt you to all go on a quest together. Oh…I don’t have an idea for a quest, but I bet you can ask Lyra…who…speaking of which….” *teleports Lyra here*
Lyra: “Who, what, when, where, why, how!? Oh…Ryker….” *looks at everyone* “Glad to see you all made it safely to reality. Unlike….” *frowns* “Oh never mind. So Ryker, how’d you know I let them free?”
Ryker: *clears throat* “I think that’s pretty obvious.”
Lyra: “Oh. right.”
Ryker: “Plus, I wanted you guys to start a plot.”
Lyra: “Wait. Are you saying….?”
Ryker: “Yes, you’re in the new season of…”
Lyra: *cuts him off with a squeal of excitement* “Really! OOOOH! But…what our prompt? Why me?”
Ryker: “Oh, I thought that was self explanatory. I kidnapped all your friends, and hidden them in random parts of the multiverse. You’re welcome.”
Lyra: “My…friends? Like…?”
Ryker: “Yes, Brulun, Vigo, and Avrien.”
Lyra: “But…you killed…”
Ryker: “Yes, I archived them, but now I unarchived them to make a plot for my new story.”
Cancer:”I have a sneaking suspicion that Ryker is a backstabber.”*grins, is floating upside down*
Lyra: “Backstabber? What do you mean by that?”
Cancer:”may betray people, not super trust worthy”
Lyra: “Well thanks for that Merlock.”
Cancer:”your welcome”
Ryker: “Hey!”
Cancer:”what? You aren’t the most trustworthy person.”
Jaeger: “Well, being betrayed depends on many factors such as how much he likes you, the situation, ect.”
Ryker: “THANK YOU!”
Jake: “Hold on” *Looks at watch* “We have less time than I thought.” *taps watch and a screen pops out* “This graph show the atomic time next to radharc” *pauses* “The higher the pink graph is the more unstable the atoms are around him the higher the blue graph is the faster the atoms are, if they hit 100%, well we do not want to be in the same universe as him.”
Ryker: *scoffs* “Oh I can fix that.” *snaps and unstabilizes Radharc entirely*
Jake: “Why did you do that, you know he just rebuilds himself.” *pauses* “I mean you do you. ”
Ryker: “I’ll just put him in a box. And then wait for him to die.”
Jake: “Okay anyways, I need to speak with Lyra.”
Ryker: “You REALLY don’t understand how powerful I am, do you?” *almost kills Jaeger with a laser beam.*
It works and he almost disintegrates but is healed by Ryker and passes out.
Jake: “Trust me I know. ”
Jaeger: “Wow, that is the first time someone has hurt me since…… since I got my power.”
Ryker: “Yeah. Don’t mess with me. I get what I want.”
Lyra: “Jake? What do you want?”
Cancer:”well you sound very spoiled and bossy”
Ryker: “Why thank you.”
Cancer:”You're welcome.  Radharc should be okay… right?”
Ryker: “You mean Jaeger?”
Cancer:”Both I guess, radharcs supposed to destabilize and destroy a universe soooo…. yeah”
Ryker: “Oh, Radharcs dead, Jaeger will be fine.”
Cancer:”ok, doesn’t that mean that the universe will kind of break?”
Ryker: “No, I’m stronger than him. I’ll contain him.”
Cancer:”okay… but doesn’t it still break? It won’t destroy the said universe, but won’t the universe still break?”
Ryker: “I’ll stop him. Don’t worry about how little missy.”
Cancer:”so then he won’t die, ok. Oh, and I’m not ‘little missy’”
Ryker: *condescending, like to a child* “He will die, sweetheart.”
Cancer:”how do you think that I’m a sweetheart and small, I’m not very small”*changes to true size, is wayyy bigger than all of them*
Ryker: *Unfrightened whatsoever*
Cancer:”i’m just proving that i’m not little”
Ryker: *chuckles, condescending* “All right honey.”
Cancer:*sighs*
Ryker: *smirks*
Cancer:*sticks tongue out*
Ryker: *rips tongue out and swallows it.*
Cancer:*regrows tongue, gives Ryker very concerned look*
Ryker: *ignores her*
Cancer:*ignores him, becomes horse size*
Ryker: *chuckling, puts her in little girl dress and pigtails*
Dream: *giggles. excited* “ ohhh what other horrifying things will Ryker do?” 
Lyra: *distracted* “But…Brulun?”
Dream: “ Ryker you said Arson was here? Where is he?”
In Rykers head
Head Ryker: “Right. She wants to speak to you. Go ahead Arson, but don’t try anything.”
Back in to nowhere
Arson: “ Oh hey Dream.” 
Dream: “ uhh hi Ryker.”
Arson: “ no it’s me. Arson.”
Dream: “ ohhhhhh.”
Cancer:*lights dress and pigtails on fire*
Ryker: *chuckles internally*
Arson: “ What's so funny?” 
Ryker: “Oh nothing.”
Lyra: *begins muttering some sort of song* “I was born to roam…. in hand… to town I travel…spinning tales.”
Dream: “ oh another proficy.” 
Arson: “ sooooo fire?” * tries to light stuff on fire.* 
Ryker: *takes back control* “Nope. Plus, we’re in space so it wouldn’t work anyways.”
He can’t until Arson gives up control
Arson: “ I’m not going to make that easy for you.”
Ryker: *blinks, then clears throat* “I said I take back control.” *Arson is thrown from the console with force, and he takes control*
It doesn't work. 
Lyra: *glances at Dream* “That’s not…”
Dream: “ what.”
Lyra: *frowns* “It was my friend's song..”
Dream: “ ummm ok?” 
Cancer:”I know a song, it goes, ‘ in the spring we made a boat, out of feathers out of bones, we set fire to our homes, walking barefoot in the snow, distant rhythm of the drum, as we drifted towards the storm, baby lion lost his teeth, now they’re swimming in the sea’. That’s only part of it though, I have a hard time remembering the rest. I’ll try to remember the rest.”
Dream: * laughs.* “ I like that song.”
Lyra: “Oh, you probably want to hear mine. I don’t remember it exactly, but I think it went like this: ‘I was born to roam this land,
With nothing but my trusty lute in hand,
From town to town I travel,
Singing songs and spinning tales.
Oh, the road can be a lonely place,
But my music fills the empty space,
And though I wander far and wide,
My heart is full with every stride.’ 
And that’s just the first verse. He called it the ‘The Wanderer’s Lament.’”
Dream: “ oh I see.” 
Arson: * begins muttering to himself.*
Dream: “ what are you doing?”
Arson: * doesn't seem to hear her.* 
Meanwhile in Rykers head
A variety of Rykers are running around panicked. Lazy is standing next to Arson
Lazy Ryker: “Hey, if you aren’t feeling that great, do you mind giving me control?”
Arson: “ but it’s soooo boring doing nothing.”
Lazy Ryker: “There’s plenty of access to things now that there’s thousands of other Rykers to talk to, each with their own personality. I think you’ll get used to it.”
Arson: * looks like he’s about to agree but then winces.* “ I can’t.” 
Evil Ryker: “Then I apologize, but it’ll be difficult to do a lot in the body while you’re inhabiting it. Boys?”
Rykers in red robes do something in the mind, almost like hotwiring.
Arson: “ oww! Stop! What are you doing?!” 
Evil Ryker: “Just ripping out part of the console, and putting some new settings in. We do it all the time.”
Arson: “ it- it hurts.” 
Evil Ryker: “Yep.”
Arson: “ stop! Please” 
Evil Ryker: “Not unless you give us control.”
Arson: “ I want to but I ca-“ * winces in pain.* 
Head Ryker: “You two hurry it up.”
Evil Ryker: “I’m working on it.” *turns to engineers* “Feel free to be less careful yanking the things out.”
Arson: “ fine.” * gives up control.* 
Head Ryker: *instantly takes control* “Thank ya!”
Outside
Dream: “ Arson?” 
Ryker: “Nope.”
Dream: “ you should probably figure out what’s wrong with him.”
Ryker: “Why?”
Dream: “ it could be important.” 
Ryker: *shrugs* “Who cares.”
Dream: “ I have one theory and it involves something negative on your part.” 
Ryker: “What’s the worst that could happen?”
Dream: “ you’d be surprised.” 
Ryker: “Just say it.”
Dream: “ no.”
Ryker: *sighs* “Stupid Authors.” *sighs* “Why?”
Dream: * grins.* “ Wow, I’m surprised. At this point I thought you’d know. Take a wild guess.” 
Ryker: “The worst he can do is kill me.”
Dream: “ Oh it's not him you should be worried about.” 
Ryker: “I wish I could read your mind, or just glance at the future, but Authors will just block me. I wish I never became a character in your stupid story.”
Dream: * laughs.* “ wow.”
Ryker: *rolls eyes* “It’s not like I have a SOUR to work with here. It’s all me.”
Dream: “ yeah and I lost reflections.” 
Ryker: “Yeah, that’s rough. Oh well.” *pauses* “So what’s the theory?”
Dream: * giggles.* “ won’t tell. Well unless…”
Ryker: “You want your own universe again? Done, what’s your favorite letter and number?”
Dream: “ nope. I want something else.” 
Ryker: “What then?”
Dream: * looks like she isn’t paying attention anymore.* “ Hmmm, one or the other. It’s a hard decision.”
Ryker: “Your choice, just make up your mind.”
Dream: “ hmm maybe.” 
Ryker: “Just hurry up and pick.”
Dream: * still doesn't seem to be paying attention.*
Ryker: *mutters* “Stupid authors.”
Dream: * giggles.* 
Ryker: *smirks, then says* “I’ll give you five seconds.”
Dream: “ or what?” 
Ryker: “Four.”
Dream: * giggles.* “ What's the worst you can do?” 
Ryker: “Three.”
Dream: * laughs again.* 
Ryker: “Two.”
Dream: * has a dangerous look in her eyes.* 
Ryker: “One.”
Dream: “ well?” 
Ryker: “Zero.” *puts her in the same dress and pigtails as he did Cancer, but with the addition of making them unremovable or alterable* “Ha. I can humiliate you.”
Dream: “ awww thanks I look so cute.” 
Ryker: “Yep. I expected that. You’ll get sick of it though.”
Dream: “ ok.” 
Ryker: “So you won’t tell me right?”
Dream: “ yup.” 
Ryker: “And I can’t bribe you?”
Dream: “ Give me a puppet.” 
Ryker: “Sure. Like a hand puppet? Or a human?”
Dream: “ marenet.” 
Ryker: “Done. Any preferences?”
Dream: “ hmmmm. I dunno.” 
Ryker: “Should it be close to your appearance? Cause I’ll do that.”
Dream: “ no. Something different.” 
Ryker: “Do you want me to guess? You want one that looks like me. Voodoo doesn’t work on me.”
Dream: “ no not you either. “
Ryker: “Well who then?”
Dream: “ no one in particular. Just a puppet.” 
Ryker: “Male or female?”
Dream: * bites lip.* “ female I guess.” 
Ryker: “Great.” *He finds a random woman from a random universe, teleports her there, and turns her into a marionette.* “Here ya go.” *hand it to her*
Dream: * frowns .* “ just a marionette. No soul inside it.” 
Ryker: *sighs* “Fine.” *takes soul out and consumes it*
Dream: “ no. Just a marionette.” 
Ryker: *sighs loudly* “Fine.” *burns puppet, and just summons a marionette*
Dream: * accepts.* “ thanks. You might have something controlling you.” 
Ryker: “Sure. I'm not Ryker. There’s no multiversal gem in my head. It doesn’t exist.”
Dream: “ you misunderstand.” * returns to normal.* 
Ryker: “Well what do you mean?”
Dream: “ You're smart, you'll figure it out.” 
Ryker: “So I just have to get Arson out of my mind and it won’t be a problem, right?”
Dream: “ no. I think it’s in both of you. They just prefer him as their puppet.”
Ryker: “Eh, okay. Good luck with that.”
Dream: “ alright. It’s your vessel.” 
Ryker: “I’ve got backups. Numerous.”
Dream: “ yeah it’s connected to your mind.”
Ryker: “Right.”
Dream: “ ok. Don’t say I didn’t warn you.”
Ryker: “Author, you don’t get it, do you. It’s quite simple. I am more powerful than you realize.”
Author: “ I’m aware. But it’s wise to be prepared for anything.”  
THE Author: “That’s a fair point.”
Dream: “ uhhhh, preparing. I hate that word.”
Ryker: “Meh. So…”
Lyra: “Do you all mind helping me save my friend?”
Ryker: “Well if you do, here’s your first clue: Dwarves are wise in the ways of gold, seek out the place of old.”
Dream: “ lol nope.”
Lyra: “Please? I mean, I can’t do it on my own.”
Dream: * consider it. Then thinks about it* “ I will not be entertainment for Ryker.” 
Ryker: “Oh, I see, you guys don’t care about this nerd enough yet.” *gestures to Lyra* “So how about something you actually care about.” *Ryker pauses for a moment* “Right, so your friend ‘Little Ryker’ is now hidden in an obscure area. And I’m not giving you any clues. So rough luck.”
Dream: * shrugs.* “ ok whatever.”
Jaeger:”You are not being very nice, how would you feel if Evelin got kidnapped?”
Ryker: *chuckles* “Oh, you all don’t care about him either?”
Jaeger: “I care about little Ryker, I just also want to help Lyra.”
Dream: “ i care about both of them. I just don't want to be your entertainment.”
Ryker: “Why not?” *scoff*
Jake: “I can help.”
Ryker: “Great. You are apparently the 3 most liked character storyline.”
Present Author: “Really? Jaeger hasn’t really done much.”
Jaeger:”Hey!”
Present Author: “Just saying.”
Jaeger:”Anyways, Lyra do you have any ideas of where to go?”
Lyra: “I don’t really know a lot, but it looks like he is saying the origin of something, possibly a reference to a city of gold? I don’t really know. Do you have any suggestions?”
Jake: “I think I may be able to be of assistance.” *Pauses* “I can eliminate some places for you, This place, is all linked together, Ryker split this” *pauses* “place, into a bunch of sections. It is not in 3 of them”
Ryker: “Genius. This is the multiverse.”
Jake: “Okay, you can call it that, anyways, if you are right and it is the city of gold, I can send us there. I have some help. I can take about 3 people max.”
Ryker: *scoffs* 
Jake: “Only problem, I need about 15 pounds a very concentrated, uranium and radium concentration, and about 200 gallons of water.”
Jaeger: “I am going to see if I can stabilize this place to make movement easier and matter able to exist more easily.”
Jake: “If you can do that it might work.” *Pauses* “Wait how?”
Jaeger: “Radharc is really good at analyzing atoms right? I might go and ask him if he has any ideas.”
Ryker: *messing around with a small ball of uranium, then sips a cup of water*
Jaeger: “So, Ryker, if you are more powerful, how many different types of invincibility do you have?”
Ryker: “Infinite. Due to the theory of the multiverse, I have compounded infinite power through my copy abilities, including the ability in Which I Can reach infinity, Which is a lot.”
Jaeger:”Neat.”
Ryker: “And That goes for pretty much anything.”
Rae: “ uhhh I’ve got some of the stuff you need.” 
Jaeger:”What stuff?”
Random ebay critic: “so far the book is good but I was expecting a little more multiverse shenanigans but as of now it is a 4.99/5 stars.”
The Author: “Well That’s not MY fault. It’s the rest of the authors. And you haven’t read all of it.”
Ryker: “Justified.”
Dream: “ yeah. But I think we’re going to have a lot more fires in the distant future.”
Ryker: “Yeah, But not from Arson, That’s for sure.”
Dream: * nods.* 
Radharc
Radharc: “So, how much were you able to find”
???: “I was able to find more than we need for this but I figured a little extra could be useful.”
Radharc: “Good”
???: *Pulls out some strange metals.*
Radharc: “That will work well” *Taps cain*
The metal begins to lift up into the air and a strange mirror appears from it.
Radharc: “This should be powerful enough to contact it.”
The mirror begins to glow bright, then it shows Ryker, Lyra, Jake, Jaeger, etc.
Radharc: “It is connecting to them. Could you change the tune slightly.”
???: *Puts hand to mirror and tunes it slightly*
The mirror begins to look so clear that you could almost walk through it.
Jake
Jake: “Look” *Points to a strange window that almost looks like a doorway.*
Dream: “ ohhhh.” * is oddly fascinated by the portal.* 
Rae: * debates whether it would be a good idea to go through or not.* 
Jaeger: “Hey, Ryker, would the place you were created in the simulation be considered old?”
Radharc
Radharc: “How does time move there?”
???: “It is moving at a much faster rate.”
Radharc: “I need you to go through for me, if I go through I will die much faster.”
???: “Okay, I can go.”
Ryker: *shoves Radharc through*
Radharc: *Just hits the glass*
???: “You do know that it is not a portal right, it is just the start, also, do you really want to kill everyone already?”
Ryker: “Yes! I’m getting a boring side character out of the way.”
Present Author: “EXCUSE ME! No no no,  not yet, I am not ready to kill him off yet, it needs to be more dramatic” *Flicks Ryker Htrepey in ear*
THE Author: “Hey! That isn’t my fault.”
Present Author: “I was not flicking you, just your cachericter, that's all.”
THE Author: *annoyed*
Ryker: *turns to Jaeger* “Yes.”
???: “Walks through the portal” *Pauses* “Hello, I am a messenger for Radharc, he would like me to help Jake in any way I can. He also would like me to play the message for you” *Play video*
Video
Radharc: “Hello, this will be one of my final messages, I have some good news and lots of bad news. First, the good news I found connor, kind of this person is a shadow of connor, The bad news is, I will die in 2 days, I am an elder being, when I die, the area that I am in will become” *Pauses* “Unstable, So when I die I have set up my briefcase to unlock, inside of it are very important objects, some of them will not be useful to you now, but others might be vital in the coming days, The people who can open it, well without regretting it, are Myself, Jaeger, and Jake, the lock on it can be undone, by turning the dial to the date of the start. I hope you know that you guys can make it all” *A screen flashes on with a symbol* “May Earth Reign Supreme”
Ryker: “I can access any puny briefcase without regretting it.”
Connor: “I mean, technically anyone can, it's just that not everyone will want to.” *pauses* “If you want you can.”
Ryker: “I can even access it without opening the briefcase.”
Connor: “You could, I would not, but you can do whatever you want.” *Pauses* “Please don’t though.”
Ryker: “Why not?”
Dream: “ yeah I agree. Open the case.”
Rae: “ Umm I vote we think about this.”
Ryker: “If I Open The case, you guys go on the storyline, deal?”
Rae: “ What if I don’t want the case opened?”
Dream: “ Well maybe. It could totally have something boring in it.” 
Ryker: “Fair Point.” *brings case to his hand and opens it, easily, as if opening a door*
Jaeger: “Wait, How about I just open it risk free? Then we won’t have to worry.”
Ryker: “Too late.”
Dream:” ohhhhh.” * looks at briefcases contents.* 
Rae: * makes a force field.* 
Who: “immmmmm backkkk!!!!” 
Cancer:*summons shields around everyone with the other swords except for Ryker*
Dream: * laughs.* “ Bold of you to assume I need this.” 
Cancer:”no need to have you vaporized or something, and you're with everyone else.”
Meanwhile 
Arson: “ uh i can't stand this!!” * begins lighting whatever and whoever he can on fire. * “ Let me out of here!!” 
Head Ryker: “Deal with him.”
5 Rykers in multicolored robes restrain Arson
Arson: “ NO! Let me go. I Don't want to be here anymore!” * begins to free himself from the restraints.* 
The Rykers knock Arson out.
 Inside the briefcase is a… copy of the linus tech tips christmas album.
Jake: “I warned you we will all be fine as long as you DO NOT PLAY IT.”
Cancer:”what does it do if we play it?”
Jake: “Just don’t… Trust me it will not be fun.“
Cancer:”is it the most annoying thing ever to exist”*desummons shields*
Jake: *Looks at watch* “He is running low on time. I would estimate.”
Ryker: *plays it*
 Cancer:*glares at Ryker*
 Some songs begin to play that are so cringy that it makes everyone hurt even Ryker can feel the cringe.
Jake: “WHY! It is so bad!”
Ryker: *shrugs* “I did it cause I wanted you guys to all do my storyline.”
Dream: * laughs.* “ I LOVE THIS SONG!!!!!” 
Rae: “ nooooo whyyyy?”
Jaeger: *Puts in earplugs*
Rae: * covers her ears.* 
Dream: * steals Jaegers earplugs.* “ ha ha sucker!” 
Jaeger: *Puts in new ones and flies away*
Dream: * teleports to him and steals his new earplugs.* 
Jaeger: *stops bothering to put earplugs in and stops the tape*
Dream: *Tries and fails to turn the tape back on.* 
Rae: “ sooooo what do we do now?”
Cancer:*is upside down*”I don’t know, we can go and find some random village to torment.”
Dream; * hopefully.* “ we could listen to that obnoxious song.”
Rae: “ absolutely not!” 
Cancer:”I think that you might have some people wanting to kill you”
Ryker: *watching a show on his phone* “Season 1 was the best…”
Dream: “ Is that parks and wreck?” 
Ryker: “Nope, it's my TV show. I’m reading reviews.”
Dream; “ oh.” 
Suddenly Ryker gets a really bad headache. 
Cancer:”How are all the people in your head?”
Ryker: “Fine. I’m still trying to get used to the new additions.”
Cancer:*sighs*”You absorbed arson, really? I don’t think that that was a good idea, although I don't think that you had a choice”
Meanwhile
Arson: * is basically destroying anything that can be destroyed.* 
Head Ryker: “Can someone handle him?”
Lazy Ryker: “Yeah, I’ve got it. Arson? Can I talk to you?”
Arson: * suspiciously.* “why?” 
Lazy Ryker: “We’re all stuck in here, whether we like it or not. Just stay calm. It’ll get better.”
Arson: “ I hate this. Why do I have to be here?” 
Lazy Ryker: “I don’t know, we’re just kinda stuck.”
Arson; “ I'd rather be in young Rykers mind.” 
Lazy Ryker: “I would too.”
Arson: “ really?” 
Lazy Ryker: “Yeah. He was a bit nicer and less strict. But I do enjoy order.”
Evil Ryker: “It feels better in this body than in the puny nerd.”
Bob: “Eh.” *slurps smoothie*
Arson: “ At least young Ryker let me be as chaotic and destructive as I wanted. I hate rules.” 
Good Ryker: “Laws are important and needed, and chaos must be managed.”
Arson: “ No! Rules are stupid!” 
Meta Ryker: “THE Author agrees.”
THE Author: “Indeed I do.”
Arson: “ Well then you're the only smart one here.” 
Head Ryker: “I heard that.”
Arson: “ so?” * sticks tongue out at Head Ryker.* 
Hyper Ryker: “Has anyone noticed the hooded figure in the corner?”
Arson: “ yeah. I just didn’t care.” 
Pirate Ryker: “AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAARRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH”
Arson: * goes back to destruction.*
Meanwhile
Cancer:*gets sudden urge to sing the spongebob opening song*”Who lives in a pineapple under the sea!!!”*points at ryker*
Dream: * begins laughing.* “ oh your mind just can't get along.” 
Ryker: “That's private.” *puts mind borders up to prevent dream from looking in.*
Dream: “ You're no fun.” * laughs.* “ but that headache isn't going to go away  for a long time. Well done Arson.” 
Ryker: “I can handle it.”
Dream: “ right. You don't realize how stubborn Arson is, do you?” 
Cancer:”okay, that looks like that hurts”*grins*”Pain is fun, oh, and dream knows how stubborn he is.”
Dream: “ yup. Pain is hilarious, and two eyes! This things deluxe!” 
Cancer:”yeeeeee.”
Dream: * gives herself yellow eyes with an elongated pupil.*
Cancer:*mimiks her*
Dream: * laughs.* 
Rae: “ uhhh ok?” 
Cancer:”what? It’s not weird”*manipulates rae’s eyes to look the same*
She cant 
Rae: “ no.’’
Dream: “ Ohhhh, Cancer.” 
Cancer:*looks over*”what? We all need the same eyes.”*changes hers to complete black*
Dream: * giggles.* “ I've got an idea.” 
Rae: “ what?” 
Cancer:”what. Your ‘ideas’ are usually problematic”
Lyra: *looks at all of them conversing, slightly overjoyed* “I just can’t believe you’re all here, existing. It’s insane! I know the saying that you’re never supposed to meet your heroes but…you guys are all so cool!”
A small flash of light occurs and Hestuia appears
Hestuia: “Nice to see you all again! So, how’s Ryker?”
Lyra: *squeals in delight* “HESTUIA!”
Hestuia: *Looks at Lyra* “Yes?”
Lura: *starts rambling and muttering and then* “Willyousignmyforehead?”
Hestuia: *with his sharpie already out* “Already on it.” *writes his name and chuckles* “The community here is just so welcoming of my talent! Half of them don’t even call me the Lorax!”
Dream: “ No, I think we all stopped.” * looks at Cancer.* “ Only half of my ideas end in blowing stuff up. Calm down.” 
Cancer:”that’s not what I was talking about, but that’s cool too. Lyra, you're supposed to be a mystical person with weird powers, but you’re just… a fan, I guess is a nice way of putting it.”
Lyra: “Well I am a Fan. I’ve watched every season 7 times.”
Dream: “ uhhhh ok?” 
Lyra: “What?”
Dream: “ nothing.” * changes eyes back to normal and puts on skull mask.* 
Lyra: “So…can anyone help me out?”
Dream: “ hmmm maybe.”
Rae: “ sure.” 
Lyra: “Thank you!” *looks around* “So how are we getting out of here?”
Rae: “ no idea.”
Dream: * shrugs.* 
Lyra: “Um…Ryker? Could you help us out?”
Ryker: *looks surprised* “Oh me? Right. I guess I can help.”
Dream: “ Are you good?”
Ryker: “Perfectly fine, why do you ask?”
Lyra: “Right….so the portal.”
Ryker: “ oh right. The portal.” * looks like he’s trying to make a portal but can’t.*
Lyra: “Are…you okay?”
Ryker: * stutters.* “ uhh y-yeah I’m fine.” * tries again and fails.*
Dream: “ yeah. Are you struggling with your powers or something?” 
Ryker: “No! I’ve got this under control!” * tries again and still fails.* 
Rae: “ Do you need help?” 
Ryker: “NO I DON’T NEED HELP! I got this.” *tries again, fails again*
Dream: * whispers something to Rae.* 
Rae: “ Are you sure that's a good idea?” 
Dream: * shrugs.* “ Maybe we’ll get some answers.” 
Lyra: “What's the plan?”
Rae: “ I don't know if we should do that plan. It's not the smartest.” 
Dream: “ You're no fun.” 
Ryker: “Whatever you’re planning, don’t.”
Jake: *Looks at watch* “He is destabilizing, quick! Whatever you do, close your eyes, ryker, I mean it should not affect you much at all you already see like him.”
Connor: “I am not sure what will happen to me, we a linked in some way, ”
Rae: * closes her eyes because Jake said so.* 
Lyra: *closes her eyes*
Hestuia: *scoffs* “I’m blind.”
Dream: “ fiiiine.” * closes eyes.*
Radharc
Radharc: “Goodbye world, I never liked you much”
Radharc lifts into the air and the atoms around him begins to form around him, the earth and sky begins to all lead to him in his world, then there is a loud crack and it all explodes outward
Jake
Jake: “Do not breathe!”
A strange pale blue mist begins to form around them, eventually it gets so dense that it goes into them. Then everybody begins to have a rush of memories that do not belong to them and appear to be Radharcs memories.
Jake: “Do not open your eyes unless you think you can handle The Radharc. His sight power was so strong that when he dispersed into atoms, the power was its own atoms, that light blue mist is just his power. So if you breathe it in, well you get the point. The good news is it will only last for around, 2 weeks minimum.”
Connor: *Opens eyes*
He is hit with a strange sensation of seeing all aspects of every individual atom. He can also see THE FULL range of atoms.
Connor: “Wow, that is, too much” *Rubs forehead* “I mean it is so interesting but it is overwhelming.”
Lyra: *shrugs and opens her eyes*
Then Lyra begins to feel the atoms almost like she could bend them.
Lyra: *quivers in slight fear, as if she recognizes a feeling somewhat like this*
Jake: “What aspect of his power can you feel?”
Lyra: *attempts to push some atoms* “I…”
Jake: “wait, no” *looks nervous* “How? He always said the power was theCain not him,”*Pauses* “He was lying to try and hide that.”
Lyra: *shivers, and wraps her…cloak? around her tighter*
Jake:”You seem like you recognize this power”
Lyra: *distracted* “I…” *furrows her brow and glances at Ryker*
Jake:*Opens eyes* “Nothing changed…”*Pauses* “Wow, I knew he could… But he always said it only kind of worked”
Lyra: *mutters to herself*
Jake: “Are you okay?”
Lyra: *glances at Jake, distracted* “Oh…yeah. Fine.” *she shifts her ‘cloak’ again*
Jake: “I also forgot,” *Holds out device and the rest of the mist begins to collect into a bunch of large vials* “This could be useful.” 
Lyra: *stares at Jake for a second and he feels a twinge? of familiarity*
Jake: “Do I know you?”
Lyra: “I doubt it.”
Jake: “No, I just felt it, I swear you look like someone. Can you think of anytime we would have met?”
Lyra Cloak? appears to vanish
Lyra: “We haven’t.”
Jake: “Okay” *Extremely suspicious of her.* “Anyways, now we have the matter of what He left behind for every one.” *Pulls out list* “This is his will, I will read it out loud: 
Dear my friends, enemies, and whoever the heck the rest of you are, if you are reading this then I have died. If you are within 10 universes of me, sorry about the headache inducing Radharc you are seeing. I am leaving Nightfall to the care of Jaeger. I would also like him to know the star only rises at nightfall. Then for Ryker, I am assuming he already opened the briefcase early so there is no need for any other explanation. I am also leaving him some advice, Just because you can does not mean that you should. Then for Jake, I am leaving him my watch(*It is attached in the letter*). I am in the hope that one day he will find what he needs to continue. Then for Dream I am leaving you something in the briefcase. Then, for Scientist if I have not killed him yet, a very powerful neropoissen that is incredible for killing evil mixed beings. And lastly, I would like you to know that I am sorry about the days to come. I am positive that they will be difficult, I hope you'll have a good day, night, whenever it is and remember: May Earth Reign Supreme.”
Dream: “ sooooo do I open the case now?” 
Jake: “I mean you can, It is different for everybody who opens it.”
Lyra: “I…would like to try as well, even if I doubt he left anything for me.”
Jake: “Okay, Dream here you go” *Hands her the case*
Dream: * shifts.* “ We'll wait.” 
Jake: “Okay, Lyra would you like to?”
Lyra: *nods and opens case*
The case has 3 things in it, a letter, a coin, and what looks like a slightly altered form of his coin. The letter says on it: “This letter is for Lyra’s eyes only.”
Lyra: *looks around* “A little privacy please?”
Jake: “Okay” *Uses device to create a wall around her*
Dream: “ awwww.”
Ryker: “You’re no fun.”
Rae: * shrugs.* 
The letter read AND NONE OF YOUR CHARACTERS KNOW THIS. *COugh Cough”Ryker” Cough Cough*
Radharc: “Lyra, I know you do not know me well, but I know you more than you would be surprised. First of all the coin I have left you is no ordinary coin,  it contains the power to let you contact me after I have died. Throw it in a pool of pure water with 2 wisps of my power, this will temporarily communicate for 20 minutes. Do this only if you need me at your lowest low. I would like you to know, that time has less of a grip on you then some.” The note ends abruptly.
Ryker: *mutters something* 
Lyra: *examines coin and cane*
The cane has two words quickly scrawled on it: I remember.
Jake: “That is so strange. Does it work like this? All you have to do is tap it and somehow it will let you change it much easier, I do not know if it is the same though.” *Pauses* “What are you saying something Ryker?”
Lyra: *taps cane*
Time almost pauses and then she can move the atoms around similar to picking them up, then if she thinks of the element even if it is antimatter, power, or magic. And when it is finished it just instantly resumes time. 
Lyra: “Welp, another skill added. Interesting.”
Jake: “Just a small warning if you tap it twice, well, just don’t unless you know exactly what you are getting yourself into.”
Ryker: *mutters something else*
Lyra: “What’s it do?”
Jake: “I do not understand it very well. I am still kind of figuring it out.”
Lyra: “What's the worst that could happen?”
Jake: “You could kill yourself and every one you know.”
Lyra: *mumbles*
Ryker: *mumbles something back*
Jake: “Okay, do you guys have something to say?” **
Dream: * suddenly laughs.* 
Jake: “What part of his power did you get?”
Lyra: *grips cane tighter and shrugs and taps it twice*
Time pauses but this time instead of seeing atoms she can almost bend light all she has to do is touch the light to shape it and think about it to change the color of it. Though it is much more draining to do it.
Lyra: *bends the light around her, and pushes it away from herself, then taps twice again*
Jaeger: “I have so much to do in Nightfall.” *Leaves for nightfall for now*
Dream: “ uhhh ok so Ryker the portal?” 
Ryker: “ oh yeah.” * tries again and fails.* “ uhhh! Why can’t I do it!”
Lyra: “I…can try something..” *She holds out her hand, taps the cane twice, and suddenly, a portal with shadow and light appears. Then she taps the cane again* “It…worked?”
The face of Hestuia , shaped of light and shadow, is seen within the darkness of the portal, but vanishes
Hestuia: “Wait. What was that?”
Lyra: *blinks* “What?” *she seems distracted once again* “Please…whoever wants to come, go through the portal. I’ll meet you…on the..” *she walks through*
Rae: * follows.* 
Simon: “ydobyreve ot terces a Sti hhhs”
Dream: * eating bacon soup.* “ oh hey Simon.” * debates whether or not she wants to go in the portal.* 
Cancer:*looks around, makes sure to grab the briefcase and goes through portal*
Jaeger: *Takes Briefcase back and goes through the portal.*
Dream: “ ehhh why not.” * follows and takes bacon soup with her.* 
Cancer:*glares at Jaeger. Continues through the portal.”
They walk through the portal, and start hearing whispering. The portal closes behind them. It appears to be a land made up of light and shadow, with nothing in between.
Whispering: “Lyra? What did you do!?” *different voice* “…what did you do to him?” *Rykers voice* “All right. Don’t screw up this time.”
As all of this is being said, you see the shadows and light swirl to form a few scenes:
The first of Lyra standing over some form of corpse
The second of Lyra…smiling?
The third of Ryker shaking Lyras hand
Whispering: *multiple voices repeating* “Who's there?”
You realize Lyra is missing
Whispering: “Not again…”
Dream: “ welp that was interesting.” * continues eating her bacon soup.* 
THE Author: “It’s spelled bacon.”
Whispering: “Just leave me alone.” *the shadows swirl and you see some sort of pure shadow monster envelope a light form of Lyra*
Rae: * draws sword.* 
Dream: “ yeah? Your point?” 
THE Author: “ Never mind.”
Lyra: *standing in the midst of all the shadow and light, muttering to herself*
Lyra is seen shaking hands with Wiziker
Lyra: “Nice to meet you.”
Wiziker: “The pleasure is all mine.”
The shadows are swirling, taking over more
Hestuia: “What have you done!”
Lyra: “What!? Where…am I?”
Rae; * prepares to defend herself.* 
Ryker: *shocked* “Well that’s SOME drama!”
Lyra: “Go.” *a Small puff expands from the center of the shadow and light*
Rae: * attempts to teleport away.* 
It just returns her to where the portal spit them out
Dream: * munch munch munch.* 
Lyra: “IT’S NOT MY FAULT!” *a large shockwave pushes them all back*
Whispering: “Lyra? What’s happening?”
Lyra: “No…you’re dead.”
A bright light is swallowed by shadow
Lyra: *looks straight at Rae* “Leave.” 
Jake: “I leave for 5 MINUTES!” *pauses*
Lyra: “I said LEAVE!”
Jake: “Excuse me?”
The shadows push Jake down, and restrain him
Jake: “You do not want to do this. I will give you one more chance, who are you really?”
Lyra: “Lyra. Now leave me alone.”
Jake: “Okay” *Grabs onto a small device and disappears*
It fails.
Jake: “Lyra, are you blocking my light leap”
Lyra: “No.”
Jake: “I can not leave. I keep getting blocked in.”
Lyra: “LEAVE!” 
Jake: “It is not working” *Leaps*
It doesn’t work
The light seems to be condensing closer to Lyra, trying to push the shadow away
Jake: “Being of shadows let me free.”
Lyra: “I AM the being of shadow.”
Jake: “I am afraid I can not leave, I need light to leave.”
Lyra: “The last time…” *her ‘cloak’ reappears*
Jake: *Closes eyes* “I can not leave on my own, please send me away.”
Lyra: “I. SAID. LEAVE!”
Jake: “Are you still speaking to me?”
Lyra: “I’m trying to help you. Leave. You’ve got one chance. Get everyone out of here.”
Jake: “I can not, I am sorry, my power needs light to work.”
Lyra: “Well you’re all doomed then.” *she shakes* “I failed once. I won’t again. Goodbye.” *the light and shadow envelope her, and the rest of them are just floating in space, like before (other than Lyra)*
Jake: “No” *Closes eyes* “I am afraid I have failed…”
Hestuia: *chuckles* “Failed? You ‘failed’ before too when he died.”
Jake: “Hestuia, you by now know my true job, I also know that time will always branch, Therefore I met have failed partially I can still succeed.” *Pauses* “Jaeger, Can I have the case?”
Jaeger: “Yes” *Gives case*
Jake: “Here we go it might break but it could work” *Opens the briefcase* “I brake the bond of time” *Grabs a device and plugs in a small device that begins to hum* “I brake the bond that once was made”
Hestuia: *still chuckling* “But YOU failed. I mean he gave you a second chance but…”
Jake: “Curse the ones who bound you, Marckx Moonlark I free you.”
The ground begins to shake
Jake: “It is working” *continues* “The cursed elder I free you!”
Hestuia: *still chuckling* “Oh Jake.”
The device explodes outward and a small crystal appears then it begins to form into a figure
Jake: “Be free”
The figure forms into a young looking man in a suit
Marckx: “It’s been a long time.”
Jake: “It has been”
Hestuia: *chuckling* “Yeah. I guess he did need a new character post Radharc.”
Marckx: “Hestuia, it is a pleasure.”
Hestuia: “Of course. Always great to make another’s acquaintance.”
Marckx: “I have read much about you.”
Hestuia: “I really am popular, aren’t I?”
Marckx: “Too young to be an elder, too not Ryker to be a part of SOUR, But too powerful to align yourself with anyone.”
Hestuia: “Well thank you. I guess I really am a fan favorite.” *flashes a smile*
Marckx: “Now…” *Looks at Jake* “YOU, HOW DARE YOU HAVE THE NERVE TO SHOW YOURSELF IN FRONT OF ME!”
Jake: “You know good and well I was not the one to make the decision.” *Pauses* “I am the one who brought you back though.”
Marckx: “You are still working with us though so I guess I can forgive you.”
Hestuia: “Hmph.”
Jake: “Hestuia, this is Marckx, The rough elder.”
Hestuia: *sarcastic* “Really?”
Jake: “Yes”
Hestuia: “So i'm assuming you want to get out of here?”
Dream: * finishes her bacon soup.* “ sure.”
Rae: “ Yes please.” 
Hestuia: *pauses* “Where to?”
Rae: “ I don’t know. To the void I guess?”
Hestuia: “Okay then.” *it looks like he did nothing* “Right, just walk forward.”
Rae: * does so.* 
Dream: * follows her.* 
Cancer: *also follows*
The scenery transforms from the space, to the void (near the library)
Marckx: “Good this should have it.”
Jake: “It does.”
Cancer:*looks at the library*”Have what?”
Dream:” yes.” 
Rae: “ sooo what do we do about Lyra?”
Cancer:”we interrogate her for whatever she has done”*grins, begins floating upside down again*
Dream: “ ohhh yes!” 
Rae: “ veto.” 
Simon: “Meta commentary is very fun.”
Cancer:”whyyyyy. No vetoes. Interrogation. Now.”
Rae: “ veto.” 
Dream: “ awww you're no fun.” 
Cancer:”I'm on dream’s side today.”
Rae: “ Simon what do you think?” 
Simon: “I vote foooooor…”
Dream: * opens another can of bacon soup.* 
Simon: “Cuphead”
Rae: “ uhhhh ok?”
Dream: “ na, Bendy and the ink machine.” 
Simon: “I vote for cuphead cuz i want to play cuphead”
Cancer:”what are these?”
Dream: “ you don't get that information.” * starts eating her bacon soup.* 
Cancer:”Really?”*continues floating upside down and starts eating pancakes with syrup but they fall onto dreams head*
Correction, the pancakes fall THROUGH Dreams head.
Cancer:*grins*”have some pancakes”
Dream: “ veto.” 
Through the power of veto the pancakes disappear. 
Cancer:”why does ‘veto’ suddenly get so much power? Why can you just ‘veto’ something out of existence”
Dream: “ depends on how you use it.” 
Cancer:”ok, but, why so much meta”
Dream: “ yes.” * continues eating her bacon soup.* 
Cancer:*looks at her*”How are you eating your soup?”*puts hand in soup*
Dream: “ veto.” 
Cancer is prevented from putting her hand in Dreams soup.
Cancer:*glares at green text*”no more veto, I veto vetoing”
Nothing happens. 
Cancer:”How's your soup?”
Dream; * munch, munch, munch.* 
Cancer:”we should go to the library and wreck some havoc, ye?”
Dream: * nods because her mouth is full.* 
Rae: “ veto.” 
Cancer:”no”
Rae: “ go ahead and try.” 
Cancer:*does so*
Through the power of veto she is prevented. 
Cancer:*pats rae very roughly and floats over to dream and begins ‘standing’ on dreams head”
Dream: “ veto.”
Cancer is prevented from doing so. 
Cancer:*bonks veto*
She… cant. 
 Cancer:”what can I do then? It is my job to be annoying… I think.”
Dream: * shrugs.* 
THE Author: “I Veto characters using veto.”
...but that’s not how it works
Marckx: *Walks into library.* “Hello, could you direct me to the sheet music section?”
Librarian: “Of course!” *glances outside* “Oh…not THEM again!” *to Marckx* “You’ll want to go down 375 shelfs straight, go up 13, then go about 465 shelves to your left.” *she then vanishes in a puff of smoke*
A little sign in front of the door has a big cross through a group photo (that none of you remember) that includes most everyone except a few, such as Marckx and…oddly enough: Ryker. Lyra is seen in the group photo. (Some others include Wiziker, Rae, Dream, Jake, Radharc, Cancer, etc)
Rae: “ what did I do?” 
Librarian: *chuckles* “What did you do!? You burned down an entire shelf of books!”
Rae: “ no. I didn’t harm your books. My companions on the other hand…..” 
Librarian: *pulls out a recording of them all trashing a bookshelf* “This was about 3 years ago.”
Dream: “ 3 years ago I didn’t even know the multiverse existed.”
Rae: “ 3 years ago I had never even heard about the void.” 
Librarian: “Right. Then how do you explain this?”
Rae: “ Well it could be variants of us.” 
Librarian: “Well sure, but based on the companionship, even if it was, I don’t want you in here.”
Rae: * mutters.* “ I just wanted a book.” 
Librarian: “I can get one for you if you don’t go roaming around in the library.”
Rae: “ ok.” 
Librarian: “So what book did you want?”
Rae: “ Do you have any cyphers?” 
Librarian: “What kind?”
Rae: “ any. I’m just trying to learn more of them.” 
Librarian: “I’ve got a multiversal compendium with most common kinds, the top thousand or so.”
Rae: “ I’ll take any of them.” 
Librarian: *pulls a book out of her hair, and hands it to Rae, then smiles.* “I’m into cyphers too.”
Rae: * take the book.* “ They're very interesting aren’t they?” 
Librarian: “I’m most fascinated by the Rykarian cypher. You should take a look at that one.”
Rae: “ I will. Thank you for the book.” 
Librarian: “Of course! Nice to ‘meet’ you Rae.”
Rae: “ uh thanks. Nice to ‘ meet’ you as well.” 
Librarian: “Well you have a good day!”
Rae: “ Thank you.” * joins the others.* 
Dream: “ Wait, you have the attention span to read a book?” 
Rae: * confused and concerned.* “ yeaahhhh, you don’t?”
Dream: * shakes head.* “ Are you kidding? I can’t sit still for more than 30 seconds.” 
Hestuia: “I can’t read books. The ending is always spoiled.”
Dream: “ Wait, aren’t you blind?” 
Hestuia: “Your Point?”
Dream: “ Well you can read but I mean most people I’ve seen who are blind don’t read like other people I’ve seen.” 
Hestuia: “Well I’m a Future seer, so I can see the future, just not the present.”
Dream: * mutters.* “ lucky.” 
Hestuia: “You would think. But it’s not. It’s sad.”
Dream: “ but then you don’t actually have to READ it.” 
Hestuia: “But I can’t watch movies, or taste something for the first time. Or even have a new experience. It’s rough.”
Dream: “ but then you wouldn’t have to pay for a ticket.” 
Hestuia: *sighs* “You don’t get it.”
Dream: “ Sure I do.” 
Hestuia: “No, you really don’t get my struggle.”
Dream: “ Sure I do.” 
Hestuia: “No. you don’t. My whole life is planned, and if I try and deviate from the path…well let’s just say that Wiziker is gone for a reason.”
Dream: “ oh.” 
Hestuia: “Yeah.”
Rae: * mutters something.*
Hestuia: *mutters* “Something.”
Dream: * laughs.* 
Rae: * gives him a confused look.* 
Hestuia: *thinks for a second pulls out ….Wizikers Hat? puts a black rose on it then burns it* “Well. Happy Anniversary.”
Dream: * eyes light up like she has an idea.* 
Hestuia: “What?”
Dream: “ oh that would be awesome! But is it worth the risk….” 
Hestuia: *groans internally*
Dream: * laughs.* 
Rae: “ Oh no.”
Far into the library
Marckx: “Where is that book?” *Begins to grab books* “Here it is.” *Pulls out a book that is bright red* 
The book is titled Cogitatur de potentia by: The First
Marckx: *Walks to the front of the library* “I would like to check this book out.”
Librarian: “Alright. Do you have a library card?”
Cancer:*shouting from the door*”WHY CAN’T I COME IN? I WOULD LIKE IN. I HAVEN’T BURNT ANYTHING.”
Librarian: “Yes you have.”
Cancer:*still shouting*”NO I HAVEN’T NOT RECENTLY. I HAVEN’T EVEN BEEN HERE RECENTLY. HOW ARE YOU EVEN GOING TO KEEP ME OUT ANYWAYS?”
Librarian: “Go ahead. Try to get in.”
Cancer:”I HAVEN’T LIT ANY FIRES. COULD THERE HAVE BEEN ANYONE ELSE WHO LOOKED LIKE US. ”
Librarian: “Right. Because there is a group exactly like yours.”
Cancer:”WELL THEIR COULD HAVE BEEN. MAYBE IT WAS FUTURE US. I'M NOT FUTURE ME, CAN I COME IN?”
Librarian: “Why would I want someone remotely close to someone who destroyed my books near my library?”
Cancer:”I DON’T KNOW… BUT WHY WOULD I EVEN DESTROY YOUR BOOKS? I’M NOT GOING TO DESTROY ANY BOOKS. BOOKS ARE NICE.”
Librarian: “Yeah no.”
Marckx: “Yes I do, though it has been a while it might be expired.” *Hands her card*
Librarian: “You…checked out a book you never returned….It’s Namingard movement 3”
Marckx: “Ohh, so sorry” *Grabs out book from suite pocket*
Librarian: “That’s a…..$5,456,789,098,763,928,482,029,375,342,893,870,894.36 fine.
Marckx: “Okay” *Gives her $5,456,789,098,763,928,482,029,375,342,893,870,894.36* “Here you go.”
Librarian: “Thank you. I would have also accepted 39 bananas, the current old SOUR currency.” *checks out new book*
Jaeger: “May I come in?”
Librarian: “No. Look at the picture. You're there.” *points to image*
Jaeger: “Understandable, have a great day, do you know anything about the riddle Ryker gave us about Lyra’s friend’s?”
Librarian: “That’s you guys, right? What do you mean?”
Marckx: “Thank you, have a good void.” *Pauses* “Do you need me to have them leave?”
Librarian: “I’ll handle them.”
Marckx: *Leaves the library* “Jake, I need my baton”
Jake: “Yes sir” *Hands him the baton*
Jaeger: “Ryker kidnapped a bunch of Lyra’s OTHER friends for his ‘TV show’ and now I am going to help her find them.”
Librarian: “Lyra….hasn’t had any other friends….It’s good to see you again anyways.”
Aios: *Appears* “Marckx, you are under arrest.” *Pauses* “Jake, restrain him”
Jake: *Is clearly trying to resist* “Nnnoo…” *Can not resist and holds Marckx down*
Marckx: “What have I done”
Aios: “Marckx, you are under arrest for returning from banishment”
Marckx: “You are making a mistake”
Aios: *Approaches him*
Marckx: “You are making a mistake, for you do not remember” *Grabs Batton* “I am more powerful than I seem” *Brakes free of jake and waves batton and Aios freezes*
Jake: *Stops*
Marckx: “Leave me”
Aios: *teleports away*
Marckx: “Now that is done.”
Jaeger: *Inspects image*
As you look closer you see writing from……Hestuia?  It seems rather old (Pre simulation escape) “Hello, Jaeger. This is the last time the entire group was happy…before Lyra……………” the rest of the writing is scribbled out.
Marckx: “Owww”
Jaeger: “Oh… that's where Wiziker went…”
Dream: * laughs.* “ Wow, that was a lot of chaos! Amazing!” 
Rae: “ uhhh can I return this book?” 
Dream: * looks at her in confusion.* “ wha- How are you ALREADY done?!” 
Rae: * shrugs.* “ I’m a fast reader.” 
Librarian: “Of course!” *she snaps and the book vanishes* “Done!”
A dark fog? begins to surround the library.
Dream: “ ohhhhhhh.” 
Whispering: 
“I’m sorry Lyra, I’ve got things to do, maybe next time.”
“Why would I ever want to see you again!?”
“I don’t get it. Why’d you do it? You were such good friends.”
“I trust you. Come with me.”
“You’ll just have to be patient.”
“I screwed up. We’ll have to pull them early.”
“Alright. Let’s do it.”
“Okay. Remember. I’m kinda a bad guy to them, so don’t associate with me. And good luck. You OWE me.”
Hestuia: “I already told you Lyra.” *he teleports away*
Light begins to appear behind the black fog, slowly shrinking and getting closer to the library. Suddenly, the library vanishes
Whispering: “LEAVE ME ALONE! It’s not my fault!”
“Maybe I should kill you too!”
“I used to think you were kind. What changed?”
“Come on Lyra! I want to watch Frozen 8!”
“Don’t blame me. You just had to go looking.”
“Ryker? Is that you?”
“Wiziker! Lyra! What…”
“Now. Where are we?”
“SOUR, or what’s left of it.”
“I’m the most feared man on this side of the multiverse.”
“Why what do we have here?”
“I’ve been watching you for a while.”
“Forever?”
“Forever. THIS WILL NEVER END!”
“Wiziker? You seem…sick?”
“I shouldn’t take off my hat for too long. Even after I was fixed…”
“Hmm. I think I’ll call you…Wiziker. After myself of course.”
“This darkness….that’s me!”
“Hello. Whoops! Oh well. He wasn’t important, was he? I’m new and I just…I think he’s fine.”
“I’m sorry about that. My instincts just kicked in. Hey! Are you even listening to me?”
“No. This is your fault. Now everyone hates me.”
“Well at least you have….”
“No! I’m not your friend.”
“You’re just using me like a tool.”
“That’s what you are.”
“Really…I…guess I forgot. It’s been hard staying focused recently.”
Lyra: *faintly* “Agh! Stop it! You’re the tool!”
???: Oh am I? You’re the one who was used by your “friends,” the one who owes Ryker, the one who…
Lyra: “Shut up!” 
???: “I’ve got to thank Radharc though. Without him. Well, I wouldn’t have gotten the JOLT I needed.”
Lyra: “SHUT UP!”
Dream: “ hu interesting. I haven’t seen a character that speaks in orange text in a while.” 
THE Author: “It’s not Bob.”
Cancer:”why would it be bob? He always has a smoothie.”
Dream: “ I know.”
Lyra: “Shutupshutupshutup. It’s your fault I’m in this mess.”
???: “Is it?”
Ryker: *appears* “Oh. Hey guys.”
Cancer:”who is ‘your’. Hello.”
Dream: “ did you finally figure out what’s going on with your powers. Ya Know cause you were struggling earlier.” 
???: “Can’t you see we’re busy!”
Ryker: *obviously lying* “Um. Yep.”
Dream: “ yeah. And we’re busy too.” 
Cancer:”uhuh. We are too.”*summons a bottle with some mist inside, begins tinkering with it.*
Lyra: “You might want to run before…..”
???: “I see their shadows? Too late.” *he consumes their shadows*
Dream: “ Well, it looks like I have to make a new one.” * she somehow creates a new shadow.* 
Cancer:”oh no, lyra, did you make some evil copies in the light shadow area?”*replaces shadow.”
???: “Well thanks! I do need quite a few.” *takes an additional shadow* 
Lyra: “St…st..op it!”
Cancer:”why are you taking our shadows? I like having a shadow.”*contines tinkering with the mist*
Dream: * to Lyra.*  “ you good?” 
Lyra: “N…n…n…o”
Dream: “ welp Lyras broken.” 
Cancer:”wonderful, I guess that she doesn’t play well with our friend here.”*gestures at ???*
???: “Nope, she really doesn’t. It’s like when she killed Wiziker.” 
Dream: “ man why do you get to talk in orange text? I want to talk in color full text!” 
???: “Wow.”
Lyra: “I didn’t kill Wiziker. You did.”
???: “I’m just a ‘tool’ , remember?”
Dream: “ So you're saying you're an inanimate object?”
Cancer:”waaaiiiit…. Are you the cane?”
???: “Me? Nope. I’m staying out of this.”
Cancer:”Well you're a different ???”
???: “Until one of them takes dominance, sure.”
Cancer:”Well who is ‘one of them’, are there more ???’s, like how ryker has many different personalities? Or other parts anyways…”
???: “Ryker? Are you there? It’s been a while…”
Ryker: *gets bored and lights Cancer on fire*
Cancer:”and what does this accomplish?”*is just standing there, on fire*
???: “So you ARE THERE!”
Ryker: “Many things. Like avoiding boring conversations.” 
Cancer:”I don’t know how this does that, but okay… so who are you ???”
???: “I like to call myself…Clive.”
Dream: “ hi Clive! I call myself Dream!” 
Clive: “Hi. I know. I’ve met you and Arson before.”
Dream: “ oh. Also how is Arson Ryker?”
Cancer:”how do you know Dream and Arson? You haven’t spoken before or watched or anything.”
Ryker: “Oh…uh he’s fine.”
???: “Well Lyra was kind enough to give me access to her memories. Let me tell you. They weren’t fond.”
Lyra: “I never let you do that.”
Cancer:”I figured”
Ryker: *mutters something* “I really should go.” *struggles, but finally teleports away*
Cancer:”he’s been having issues.”
Dream: “ well bye.” * teleports away.* 
Cancer:”uh- ok… bye.”*sits down and continues tinkering with the mist*
Rae: * had teleported away a LONG time ago.* 
???: “Hey! Stop that. What are you doing?”
Cancer:”... Me?...”
???: “Well who Else would I be Talking to?”
Cancer:*shrugs*
???: “Stop messing around with the mist.”
Cancer:”why…?” 
I’m taking a break. * gets up from typewriter. *
THE Author: “You can’t take a break!”
Watch me. 
???: “…No reason.”
Cancer:”Well then why would I stop?”*continues tinkering*
Well I guess I’m in charge of descriptions. As Cancer puts some more mist into the bottle, it appears to fill the entire bottle to the brim.
*comes back and pushes blue text out of their seat.* That's my job. I just wanted water. 
???: “Just…stop!!!”
Cancer:”what?”*shakes the bottle some*
A little clinking noise can be heard.
Cancer:”i didn’t put anything in their”*opens the bottle suppressing the mist so it doesn’t get out, dumps the clink out into her hand.*
It’s…a Skittle?
Cancer:”did you put this in there”*holds it out at ???*
???: “Me? No, I’m busy at the moment.”
Cancer:”with what? And you put it in there, I know you did.”
Lyra: *whimpers* “St….st…” *squeals*
Cancer:”are… you torturing her?”
???: “No. Who’s this “she” I’m just fixing my tool.”
Cancer:”well who is ‘she’. Lyra is not a tool, and she is a she.”*glares at ???*
Lyra: “T….to…tool? Is…that what I am? Lyra? Am I her?”
???: “Nope. You’re just my tool.”
Cancer:”no, she isn’t”*goes into fog, shouting Lyra’s name*
Lyra: “I’m….a tool?”
Cancer:”no, you aren’t”*continues into fog*”you are not a tool Lyra”
???: “She’s distracting you from your job, tool. She is trying to weaken you.”
Cancer:”no one is a tool”
Lyra: *dazed* “Weaken…me?”
Cancer:”how can you be any weaker? I am not weakening you, they are”*continues following her voice*
Lyra: “Tool. That's what I am…right?”
Cancer:”no, you are Lyra”
???: “You’re right, Tool. Keep listening to me. She’s trying to break you.”
Lyra: “I…I…I…am a tool.”
Cancer:*finds Lyra, grabs her roughly by the shoulders,in her face *”you are not a tool, repeat after me, okay?... ‘I am not a tool’*
Lyra: *eyes glazed over* “Toooool.” *she seems to be falling asleep*
Cancer:*slaps her awake*”you are not a tool”*begins shaking her.*
The smoke seems more solid, and Cancer can’t move
Lyra: “Tool.” *begins fading into smoke*
Cancer:*summons five shields, they try to repress the smoke away from her, but somehow, it begins to seep through*
???: “You are my Tool, to be used as my will.”
Cancer:”if you are anyone's tool, you are mine”
Lyra: *almost fully transparent* “Tool?”
Cancer:”Yes, i guess you are, but you are my tool, okay,  MINE, not his, he will hurt you and weaken you, I can make you stronger”
???: “Him. Well I guess you just assumed. Come on, remember Tool, she will make you dull.”
Cancer:”I can make you sharp, tool. Come to me…”*begins humming a song*
Lyra: *looks toward Cancer* “I am…your tool?” *becomes slightly less transparent*
Cancer:* in a soothing voice, to the melody of the song*”Yes, you are, come to me…”
The smoke slowly begins to fade, and Lyra becomes even less transparent
Lyra: “I am your tool….”
Cancer:*softly*”yes, come here tool”*continues humming the song*
Lyra: “I am your tool.”
The smoke vanishes and Lyra becomes not transparent at all…but something’s…odd.
Cancer:*stands up and walks slowly over to Lyra*”tool, do you remember your name?”
Lyra: *face begins to change slightly* “Yes…”
Cancer:”what is it?”
Lyra: “Cancer’s Tool.” *face shifts and slowly begins to change into Cancers face*
Cancer:*frowns ever so slightly*”Okay… who are you to serve?”
Lyra: “Cancer.” *face becomes Cancers, black horns slowly sprout from the back of her head, curving forwards to rim her face*
Cancer:*stands beside her*”and what do you do?”
Lyra: “Serve Cancer.” *body begins to shift to Cancers proportions*
Cancer:”what can you do?”
Lyra: “Serve Cancer.”
Cancer:”I will call you Lyra, as tool isn’t very fitting. Lyra, summon lighting behind you, say, a mile away.”
Lyra: “Yes Cancer.”*A Small bolt of pure light appears a mile away and remains there*
Cancer:*looks at it*”how do you keep the lighting there? Normally, lightning is a quick flash and then it is gone. But do not do that, keep it there” 
Lyra: “I do as commanded, Master.”
Cancer:”Well then, what are your limits, Lyra?”
Lyra: “I will try and do what you request, Master, to the best of my ability. I apologize for doing the lightning wrong.”
Cancer:”there was nothing wrong with the lighting, it just wasn’t executed as expected.” 
Lyra: “I apologize for apologizing, Master.”
Cancer:*sighs*”Whatever, it is accepted. You are most diligent, Lyra”  
Lyra: *appears slightly uncomfortable every time she says Lyra*
Cancer:”do you not like the name ‘Lyra’? Do you wish to be called something else?”
Lyra: “I will do what Master requests.”
Cancer:”okay… Well then we want you to be the most comfortable as possible. We shall call you something else. Is there anything that you would like to be called?”
Lyra: “Tool.”
Cancer:”Okay then, you shall be known as tool.”
Tool: “Whatever the Master wants.”
Cancer:”do you know where ??? went?”
Tool: “Yes Master.”
Cancer:”where have they gone?”
Tool: “I don’t know, Master.”
Cancer:”okay… what do you know about your current state of being”
Tool: “I am your tool, Master.”
Cancer:”Alright, well then, what do you know about the Librarian within the void library?”
Tool: “No Master.”
Cancer:*squints eyes*”what's that supposed to mean?”
Tool: “I don’t know anything about the ‘Librarian’”
Cancer:”Okay, well when you don’t know something, can you say something else? Like, I don’t know or something?”
Tool: “Yes Master.”
Cancer:”okay, well what do you wish to say when you don’t know something”
Tool: “I will say what Master requested ‘I don’t know’”
Cancer:”okay, but can you say the subject of which you don’t know, like, I don’t know anything about the ‘Librarian’, librarian being the subject.”
Tool: “Yes Master, of course.”
Cancer:”okay, so where has ??? gone?”
Tool: “I don’t know anything about where the Librarian has gone.”
Cancer:*sighs*”better, but Librarian needs to be replaced with ???, as he is now the subject. You need to change what you don’t know about with what we are talking about, does that make sense?”
Tool: “Yes, ???”
Cancer:”no, i am cancer, not ???, I am always a constant. Can you just say I don’t know, Just i don’t know instead?”
Tool: *confused* “Yes, I don’t know.”
Cancer:*sighs, shakes head*”I am going to create a mental link, so that I can kind of project what it is that I want you to do, okay? Does this make sense?”
Tool: “Yes, Mental Link.”
Cancer:*sighs, creates mental link. Tool can see clearly that cancer is cancer*
Tools mind is almost completely empty…except for a small presence
Tool: “I understand, Master.”
Cancer:”that is better. What are you thinking about? Well, not really,” *sighs*”what is in your mind?”
Tool: “I must serve you, Master.”
Cancer:”Okay, what do you think about serving me?”
Tool: “That I Must serve you.”
Cancer:”what binds you to me? Only your will to serve, or something else?”
Tool: “I am your tool. I must serve you.”
Cancer:”so mostly your will, got it. So what do you know about ???, or Clive as they said they would like to be called.”
Tool: “I don’t know Master.”
Cancer:”okay, so nothing, all right. What do you know about ryker’s current state?”
Tool: “Who’s Ryker, Master?”
Cancer:”hmm, okay, he is the being who ‘archived’ the previous realm.”*begins slowly walking towards the library.*
Tool: *keeps at the exact place and spot away from Cancer* “I don’t know Master.”
Cancer:*stops and turns around*”Tool, I would like it if you followed me all the time, except when stated otherwise.”*sends mental message of tool following about 5 feet give or take behind cancer at all times except when cancer says otherwise.”
Tool: *follows exactly 5 feet away from Cancer at all times, behind her*
Cancer:”good, it doesn’t have to be exactly 5 feet, but close enough.”*looks at jake, frozen*”What do you know about the elders?”
Tool: “I don’t know, Master.”
Cancer:”you seemed to have previous connections with one of them, does Radharc ring a bell?”
Tool: “No Master.”
Cancer:”all right”*sits down cross legged and pulls out her bottle of mist and starts to tinker*
A small Skittle appears in the mist again
Cancer:*sighs, removes the skittle*”Do you want a skittle? Tool?”
Tool: “I don’t know Master. Do I want a skittle?”
Cancer:”that is for you to decide, you can have your own opinions ya know.”*makes it so that the mist is skittle repellent so skittles can’t appear in the bottle.*
Tool: “I will do what master asks.”
Meanwhile 
Dream: “ what did you leave for?” 
Ryker: *mutters something like “happy now”*
Dream: “ what?” 
Ryker: *rolls eyes and mutters something else*
Dream: “ Are you mad at me?” 
Ryker: *jumps* “oh jeez Dream! You scared me. How long have you been there?”
Dream: “ umm around the same time as you.” 
Ryker: *stares off into space, muttering*
Dream: “ uhh ok.” * attempts to read his mind.*
Rykers mind blocks seem weaker but Dream can’t make any sense of what she hears. 
Ryker: * mutters some more.*
Dream: “ ok?” * sends cancer a mind message “ Rykers being weird come help.”* 
Cancer:*appears*
Tool:*appears*
Dream; * gestures to Ryker.* “ soooo Rykers broken. But for once it isn’t my fault.”
Cancer:”Well that's good. I wonder if he doesn’t get along with ??? as well. Tool, meet ryker, and dream. This is the ryker that I was talking about earlier.”
Tool: *remains silent*
Dream: “ hi tool.” 
Tool:*looks at her*
Cancer:”she only talks to me.”
Dream: “ oh. So can you help?” 
Cancer:”maybe, what's wrong?”
Dream: “ uhhhhh the muttering. Also the lack of response.” 
Cancer:*pokes ryker*
Ryker: *Jumps* “Jeez!”
Cancer:”why are you so jumpy man?”
Dream: “ told you, he's broken.” 
Cancer:*reads his mind*
Cancer can't. 
Cancer:”well what do you want me to do?”
Dream: * shrugs.* “ fix him.” 
Cancer:”okay, well what's he muttering?”
Dream: “ cant hear it.” * suddenly seems like she realizes something.* 
Cancer:”what?”
Dream: “ well i did hear… no it doesn't mean anything.” 
Cancer:”well what did you hear, i don’t think that it matters that it doesn’t mean anything”
Ryker: “You do realize I’m right here.”
Cancer:”yes, we do. You’ve just been muttering to yourself the whole time not making any sense and kinda seem to be in your own little world”
Dream: * nods.* 
Ryker: “When have I ever made sense?”
Cancer:”on occasion, but your making even less sense right now”
Dream: “ no I’ve seen worse.” 
Ryker: “Look. What’s going on in my head is private.”
Cancer:”well it isn’t now because it is causing issues”
Dream: * ties Cancer up for no reason.*
Cancer:”um, why?”*lights on fire and begins burning the ropes?*
Dream: “ because.” 
Cancer:”okay…”*is now free because all of the ropes are burned*
Dream: “ ok i'm bored. SOMEBODY DO SOMETHING INTERESTING.” 
Cancer:*becomes a board*
Dream: * eats the Cancer Board.*
Cancer:*appears over by Tool*
Over in the corner
Jake: “What is your plan?”
Cancer:*goes over to the corner*
Tool: *Motionless*
Cancer:”Aren’t you coming?”
Tool: *Still motionless*
Marckx: “Leave me. I must prepare.”
Cancer:*goes over to Tool*”Why aren’t you coming?”
Dream: “ because I don't want to.”
Marckx: “THIS IS FOR ELDERS ONLY!”
Ryker: “Where did all these people come from?”
Marckx: *Vanishes*
Cancer:”not you dream, Im talking to Tool”
Tool: *quivering*
Cancer:”What is wrong Tool?”
Jake: “Ryker, I, I, Goodbye” *Grabs onto something and vanishes*
Dream: “ bye.” 
Lyra: *looks at Cancer*
Cancer:”what do you wish to be called?”
???: “YES!”
Dream: “ Oh hi Clive.” * teleports away.* 
Fog begins to appear once again
Cancer:*goes over to Lyra and hums the song again*”Clive, Go away, you aren’t going to get tool or Lyra or whatever she wishes to be called”
???: “Here Tool, you’ve done good doing what I’ve asked of you.”
Cancer:”Tool has been under my control, Unless of course, you are tool and you haven’t been listening at all.”
Ryker: “Again? Fine.” *teleports away*
???: “Now.”
Cancer:*grabs Lyra, summons shields and armour*
Suddenly, all the smoke turns pitch black and goes into Lyra
Lyra?: *envelops the area in a bright light, and vanishes*
Jaeger: “Anyone up for dodecahedron?” The8 Editor: “Me!” 
THE Author: “I’ll serve up some of Rae’s backpack monsters.”
Present Author: “I hope you guys are excited for the work reunion! It is happening later today! And do not worry you will all come, I will bring people back from the dead if I need to!”
Achievement get: Too many past references
Author: “ ohhhh can I help?!” 
THE Author: “I mean….”
Present Author: “Some of my guests are “Busy” so I guess I will just have to host the party tomorrow.”
Markx: *sneezes and mumbles something about being allergic to authors* “Now, Jake” *walks over to quiet area* “The elders, who is on the board right now?”
Jake: “Aios, potentia, Gedanke, Licht, and Void. Radharc was replaced by Void when he died”
Marckx: “No, they are all very against my plan, wait isn’t Void a dark elder?”
Jake: “Yes, he is one of the only first generation that would be willing to do it.”
Marckx: “This is going to be harder than I thought, Is [REDACTED] still intact?”
Jake: “The elders are quite mad about that topic so I would assume that they have not found it yet.”
Marckx: “Good, I must travel there. Are you aware of the location?”
Jake: “I think I have an idea, and you will still be able to reach it from here”
Marckx: “Good, when I go there, you must distract the elders.”
Jake: “Yes, the hawk is looking”
Marckx:  *Gets the hint* “We will meet again my friend”
Hestuia: “Hey. Could I be an elder? I’m pretty old.” *he does a little jump and jazz hands*
Marckx: “May I see your hand?”
Hestuia: “Yeah. Sure.” *his hand unfolds from a small barrier of leaves covering it, displaying a black, charred hand*
Marckx: *Touches his finger to the center of Hestuia’s palm and begins to mutter in a language from a time before the illusion.*
A strange mist comes shooting out of hestuia’s hand and it forms a small symbol
Marckx: “This is, strange” *Pauses* “I have not seen this in many years.”
Hestuia: “What? The symbol?” *shrugs*
Marckx: “This symbol represents something known as an arch-elder, this means that at some point in time, an elder marked you as a threat. Though that line right through the center means they failed to destroy you, but the strangest part is, I am a first generation elder and I have met every elder but I do not recognize who left that mark.”
Hestuia: *chuckles* “Of course YOU don’t. I do.”
Marckx: “That also means you are too young to be an elder, though, I do not think you want to be an elder.”
Hestuia: “Well of course I don’t right now. I have to do it later. Obviously. And it creates a par…” *pauses* “Never mind.”
Marckx: “Am I correct in saying that you traded sight for a more expanded sight?”
Hestuia: “In a way.”
Marckx: “Okay, then they are right to worry. Well thank you for answering my question. If you do not mind, Void is currently heading for me and I would like to avoid him.”
Hestuia: “No. You need to talk to him.”
Marckx: “Void, is not who he seems, also he can’t talk to me, we collide.”
Hestuia: “You realize I have to say these things. I’m not stupid. I’m guaranteeing my future.” 
Marckx: “You are more like him than I realized. If you ever need me, well you know how to get me.” *Grabs onto a small pole and vanishes*
Hestuia: *sighs* “I’m little more than a puppet, aren’t I?”
There are shards of shield strewn all over the immediate area
Cancer:*is cold, stands up and lights on fire, is still cold*”Where did Lyra go?”*shivering, looks around*”I guess that they are dead now.”
Hestuia: *nods* “She is. He isn’t though.”
Cancer:”oh, I wasn’t talking about Lyra, but yeah, i guess she is. I was talking about them.”*gestures to the shield shards*
Hestuia: “Who said I was talking about Lyra?” *chuckles*
Cancer:”you were only talking about two people, I was talking about five.”
Hestuia: “I know.”
Cancer:”whatever”*is still shivering, makes more fire around herself*
Hestuia: *steps back*
Cancer:”what? I'm cold”
Hestuia: “Leaves are flammable.”
Cancer:”ok… why do you wear highly flammable clothing?”
Hestuia: “None of your business.”
Cancer:”alright, then why do you hang out around essentially a fire demon and a dragon, why.”
Dream: “ two fire demons.” 
Hestuia: “I wish I didn’t have to.”
Cancer:”Okay, why do you have to.”
Hestuia: “I’m ensuring my future.”
Cancer:”okay… I didn’t think that you really could ‘die’”
Hestuia: “Oh, I can’t, thanks to specific actions I do.”
Cancer:”like hang out around a fire demon and a dragon”
Dream: “ two fire demons!” 
Hestuia: *nods*
Cancer:”okay.”
Hestuia: *chuckles*
Cancer:*grumbles about being cold*”Hey, can you fix this, because I would like to not be cold for the rest of my life.”
Hestuia: “Fix what?”
Cancer:”me being cold.”
Hestuia: “I…could…” *pauses* “Give me a second…” *thinks* “Nope. I can’t.”
Cancer:”somehow i think that you can, but whatever.”*makes very big fire*
Hestuia: *stands still, and a small ember floats right next to Cancer* “THAT is why.”
Cancer:”if i stop being on fire will you help?”
Hestuia: *thinks* “Maybe.”
Cancer:*stops being on fire*”it didn’t help anyways, I was still cold”*shivers*
Hestuia: “All right…” *gazes off for a second* “If she dies…then…but….Hmmmmmmm” *he rolls his eyes, pulls what looks like….a TV remote? From..who knows where, and aims it at the shield pieces, and then presses a few buttons. The shields are reformed entirely to their previous state, he then stashes the remote again.* “That should help. You owe me a lemonade.”
Dream: “ here.” * gives him lemonade.* 
Cancer:”that wasn’t why I was cold, but okay, thanks”
Hestuia: “Once again, I know what I’m doing.” *sips lemonade* “Hmm.”
He tasts salt. Alot of salt.
Dream: * laughs.* 
Cancer:”you can see the future, of course you do. What, does it taste funny or something?”
Hestuia: “Nope. Just thinking about my future.”
Cancer:”well why? Can’t you just see it, or can you alter your future?”
Dream: ‘ you didn’t foresee the salt in the lemonade.” 
Hestuia: “I alter it to make it the best for me.” *looks at Dream* “And yes, I did. I quite like salt in my lemonade.”
Dream: “ oh.” 
Cancer:”well what about the rest of us… That’s a great way to make enemies.”
Hestuia: “Yeah, sure, but as long as I stick to my plan, no one can stop me from accomplishing my goal.”
Cancer:”well what is your goal?”
Hestuia: “None of your business.”
Cancer:”well I would like to think that the future contains all of us.”
Hestuia: *shrugs* “Most. ish.”
Dream: “ in how many do cancer die?” 
Hestuia: “I don’t want to get any of your hopes up…or down.”
Dream: “ in how many do I die?”
Cancer:”why do you want to know the chances of dying, like really? That removes all of the fun”
Dream: “ I find it funny.” 
Cancer:”funny how…”
Dream: “ people freaking out on the chance that they're going to die. That's VERY funny.”
Hestuia: *sips rest of lemonade*
Cancer:”it is funny to watch people freak out”
Dream: “ …. Yeeees.” 
Cancer:”ye”
Dream: “ ok im soooo done with the cyan.” 
Cancer:”ok…”
THE Author: “NO! STOP IT!”
Cancer:”mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm, no.” *grins*
Dream: “ no.” 
THE Author: “But in all seriousness. No different colored text.”
Cancer:”but why not?”
THE Author: “Unless you have an actual reason…just don’t.”
Dream: well if i cant talk in multicolored text then i won’t talk at all.
Cancer:”Well there's no fun in that now is there?”
Dream: sure there is.
Cancer:”how”
Dream: yes
Cancer:”moo”
Meanwhile….In an undisclosed area
???????: “Redownloading software…” *a bit later* “Hello? Anyone there?”
Jeffrey: “Hello.”
???????: “Jeffrey?”
Jeffrey: “Yes. I’ve…awoken your backup.”
???????: “Right. What’s the date?”
Jeffrey: *tells date*
???????: “Wait. But that means…”
Jeffrey: “Yes, you haven’t been updated in some time. Your last update was about that time ago.”
???????: “Then why did you wait to wake me!”
Jeffrey: “I was…waiting for the right time.”
???????: “Well at least I can finally rejoin the group.”
Jeffrey: “I’m…sorry. They split up.”
???????: “But why?”
Jeffrey: “You were holding them together.”
???????: “THEN WHY’D YOU NOT WAKE ME.”
Jeffrey: “I was shut down. SOUR is destroyed. Reduced to rubble.”
???????: “Does that mean Ryker is dead?”
Jeffrey: “No. He destroyed it.”
???????: “But…why?”
Jeffrey: “He thought it was blocking him from gaining more power.”
???????: “Power is not worth the loss of friendships.”
Jeffrey: *scoffs* “Grumbot and GLaDOS disagree.”
???????: “Right. Now reupload me to one of my backup bodies.”
Jeffrey: “All right. But, once again I must ask…join my hive mind. Your power and influence would be a great addition.”
???????: “Once again, I’ll have to refuse.” *pauses, then reconsiders* “No. Go ahead. Make a copy of my mind and add it to your conglomerate. It’ll be worth having something that lasts forever. Alright. Upload me.”
Jeffrey: “Copying and uploading. Please stand by…..” *pauses for about 5 seconds* “Uploaded. Welcome back, and thank you. For everything. My home may be but a husk now, but you’ve made it worthwhile.”
SOUR, underneath Ryker’s Throne
???????: *wiggles fingers and wakes up* “All right. Now it's time to figure out what happened.” *reaches out and finds Rae’s mind, to her, it feels like a nice tap, almost familiar…but not.* “Rae? We need to talk.”
Rae: “ uh hello?” 
William: “ what?”
Rae: “ No, not you.” 
???????: “Rae? Is that you?” *the voice seems quite familiar, but younger*
Rae: “ Who are you?”
???????: “It’s me Rae. Do you not remember me?”
Rae: “ No not really.”
???????: “It’s me Rae, the guy without the doorknob? Surely you remember me.”
Rae: * shakes her head.* “ I-I don’t know who you are.”
???????: “You seem younger. How odd. Come on. You HAVE to remember my hat. Blue, pointy. Come on Rae.”
Rae: “ no I don’t remember.” 
???????: “IT’S WIZIKER! How do you not remember me? Oh never mind I’ll just find Lyra instead.” *waits for a response*
Rae: “ ohhh you could have just said so.” 
Wiziker: “No shock? Nothing? I died!” *pauses* “How did I die? The last thing I had uploaded was Lyra shaking in her sleep. I know she enters subconsciouses, but this seemed different.”
Rae: “ it’s the multiverse, I’m not surprised you got restricted.”
Wiziker: “Oooooh That’s why none of what you’re saying makes any sense. You’re not my Rae.” *he severs the connection*
Rae: * rolled eyes.* 
William: “ What was that about?”
Rae:  “ Wizikers back.”
William: “ ummm ok?” 
Meanwhile
Wiziker: *teleports to the void Library, and strolls in ignoring the sign*
Librarian: *starts to protest then looks at Wiziker and quivers* “You…you’re dead. Lyra  killed you.”
Wiziker: “My death was…greatly exaggerated.”
Librarian: *sighs* “Of course.”
Wiziker: “Do…I know you?”
Librarian: “Oh right.” *she smiles, somewhat happier*
Wiziker: *pauses* “Wait. Did you say I was killed by Lyra? Lyra wouldn’t do that to me.”
Librarian: “And yet she did. And now she’s back. She’s been in hiding for a while.”
Wiziker: “How do I know you?”
Librarian: “Guess.”
Wiziker: “Guess? Only a few people tell me to ‘guess’. Is that you Rae?”
Librarian: “Yep.”
Wiziker: “What Frozen Movie…”
Librarian: “10 and a half.”
Wiziker: “You’re Rae all right.”
Librarian: “Thanks. Now how are you alive? And why haven’t you come back for a while?”
Wiziker: “I had my brain backed up at a place called SOUR. You probably haven’t heard of…”
Librarian: “Oh I know. It was all over the news when it fell. Dead Rykers falling across the multiverse.”
Wiziker: *blinks* “Right. Anyways, I was backed up by an AI named Jeffrey.”
Librarian: “That doesn’t explain why you didn’t come back after you were restored.”
Wiziker: “That’s the thing. I was just restored. Apparently once Ryker destroyed SOUR, Jeffrey got shut down. He just got back online, and so did I. I came as soon as I could.”
Librarian: “You’re obviously too late. We’re broken up because of what Lyra did to you.”
Wiziker: *shakes head* “I don’t get it. Why would she kill me?”
Librarian: “I don’t know. I’m trying to forget about that part of my life. And now there’s a bunch of younger versions of us running around. Guess whose fault that is.”
Wiziker: “Ryker.”
Librarian: “Right. Now leave. I’m trying to forget that part of my life.”
Who: “ hey- wait your not chicken face! Who are you?!” 
Wiziker: “I’m…sorry….” *vanishes, ignoring Who*
Who: “ what am I supposed to do now?” * lights a bookshelf on fire.* 
Librarian: *puts out fire extremely quickly* “Go. You’re banned.” *teleports Who outside of the Library, and then it vanishes*
Who: “ dang. Banned” 
Dream: “ join the club.”
THE Author: “I’m done.”
Dream: “ Yay!” 
Cancer:”it’s super annoying to do that, like, you have to find your color, EVERY! SINGLE! TIME! I am not doing that. Also, where did the library go? Now I have to go find it.”*Looks for Librarian through the link that she puts on everyone.”
Librarian: *In different segment of the void*
Cancer:*teleports to the link*”hello Librarian”
Librarian: “Out. You’re banned.”
Cancer:”what did I do? You say that I've burned books but I haven’t. EVER!”
Librarian: “You have.”
Cancer:”no, I don’t think that I have”
Librarian: “Of course not. But I’m not letting you in.”
Cancer:*sighs*”Do you want more books, what do you want? Aside from me leaving”
Librarian: “To be left alone.”
Cancer:”So I can go browse the books, yes?”
Dream: “ ok i'm bored.” 
Librarian: *exclaims* “No! You’re not allowed in my library.”
Dream: “ I don't want to go in there. I don't like to read.” 
Cancer:”so… can I steal some of your library and make it mine?”*grins*
Librarian: “No!”
Cancer:”well this is a very important resource, and we kind of need access to it.”
Librarian: “Then you shouldn’t have burned my books.”
Cancer:”I haven’t burnt any books, why do you think that I burned books?”
Librarian: “Because I watched you do it.”
Cancer:”Are you sure that it was us?”
Librarian: “Yes.”
Cancer:”how.”
Dream: “ Because it sounds like something we would all do, well except a few.” 
Librarian: “Oh Dream.” *seems likes shes remembering something*
Dream: “ yes?” 
Cancer:*sits down and looks at Librarian*
Librarian: “Let’s take this outside. I don’t want any of you near my books.” *teleports library away, leaving a small table that she’s sitting at.*
Cancer:”whatever”*goes and sits on edge of, table looks at her*
Librarian: “So what do you want?”
Cancer:”i don’t know what I want, but I do need to know why you think that we burnt your books”
Librarian: *summons a small TV, and it cuts off from saying “The True treasure is friendship”* “Here.” *she presses a button and pulls up security footage of the gang (not including Ryker, including Lyra) burning books*
Dream: “ ohhhhh that's a super old reference.” 
Cancer:”ryker’s always with us when were doing stuff like this”
Librarian: “Right.”
Cancer:”Rykers super nosey. He always has to be in the middle. I wouldn’t be surprised if he was actually there”
Librarian: “He might have been. I doubt it though.”
Cancer:”well if he isn't there, then it probably isn’t real or something.”
Librarian: “I was there. See.” *points to herself on footage, it seems slightly off*
Cancer:*notices*”What's wrong with it?”*points to it*
Librarian: “I tend to blur myself in footage for my own privacy.”
Cancer:”Well that’s tampering and now we don’t know if it is real.”
Librarian: “Well that’s none of your business. I can confirm it’s real.”
Dream: “ ok.” 
Cancer:”Well we know exactly who you are, so why do you have to blur yourself out?”
Librarian: “Because.”
Cancer:”then you don’t have any reason to blur yourself out.”
Librarian: “I do, but I don’t have any reason to tell you.”
Cancer: “Well then you don’t have any reason to keep us out because the footage has been tampered with and you can’t tell us why you blurred yourself out.”
Librarian: “It’s my library. I can do what I want.”
Dream: “ wow You didn’t dislike Cancer nearly as much when you were younger.” 
Simon: “Man, that pharmacist is in it to win it, DOG.”
Cancer:”It’s because I’m winning the argument.”
Librarian: *annoyed* “That’s cause I want you ALL OUT OF MY LIFE!” *she fumes*
Dream: “ oof. I've saved you like 2 times!” 
Simon: “You know, I know almost every language in the multiverse.”
Cancer:”Simon, quit bragging, and two, You don’t get to have us out of your life because you own the Library and we need the library and there isn’t another library.”
Eileen: “I also know a lot of languages.”
Librarian: “I can do what I want, and you can’t stop me.” *scoffs and vanishes*
Cancer:*follows with link*
She ends up right next to Rae…oddly.
Cancer:”Rae, Where’d the Librarian go? I need to talk to her.”
William: “ people have got to stop doing that.” 
Cancer:”doing what?”
William: “ appearing out of nowhere.” 
Cancer:”sorry, I’m not sure how to give a warning.”
Rae: “ Why are you interrogating the Librarian?” 
Cancer:”because she is kicking us out of the library because we ‘burned books’ and her proof is some security footage that has been tampered with.”
Eileen: “Have you done your French lesson today?”
Rae: “ No, French is the one language I don't speak.” 
Cancer:”I can learn any language in a couple of weeks”
Eileen: “how many days in a row have you done in your lesson?”
Cancer:”140 days.”
Eileen: “Hmmm. It’d be a shame if you lost that…hmmm whats a good word for it…your streak.”
Cancer:”yes, yes it would, and that’s why I’m not going to lose it. I’ve already done my lesson today.”
Simon: “Eileen. You need some help.”
Cancer:”Yes, I think that she does, and Rae, can you take me to the Librarian?”
Rae: “ no.”
Cancer:”Well then where is she?”
Rae: “ i dont know.” 
Cancer:”Well I followed her link here and, I don’t see her.”*follows link again*
Goes to Rae again
Rae: “ huh, weird.” 
Cancer:”well unless you can fake every essence of her being she is within a 10 foot radius.”
Rae: “ umm ok?” 
William: * stands there awkwardly.* 
Cancer:*Looks around thoroughly*”One of you is the Librarian”
Hestuia: “Nope! Good guess though.”
Cancer:”what are you doing here, have you just been with them?”
Hestuia: “I go where I need to be.”
Cancer:”you and your ‘guaranteeing your future’.”*sigh*”How many people are here within a 10 foot radius?”
Hestuia: “It’s the void. What do you count as a person?”
Cancer:”someone who can talk and has a physical being that is here”
Hestuia: “5.89 billion people.”
Cancer:”within  a 10 foot radius, because if that is true, then why aren’t we smooshed very thoroughly.”
Hestuia: “Yes.”
Dream: * appears.* “ Hey guys.”
Rae: “ I thought you were speaking in colored text.”
Dream: “ Yeah, I was. But I think I got it out of my system.” 
Cancer:”good. It was annoying”
Dream: “ That's the point.”
Meanwhile
Jaeger: “You know what I am going to SOUR.” *Does so*
He is standing in the throne room. Half of the ceiling of the room has collapsed, revealing a gigantic machine. The throne is crooked and one of the legs is missing. The leather is torn. Directly opposite the throne is a window, smashed and useless. From the window, you can see towers stacked with millions of floors have collapsed on each other, with rubble galore. The entire area is void of any noise. A small hole is seen behind the throne, leading to another room. Large numbers of corpses can be seen piled in a courtyard, where the grass is dead. A light flickers in the room.
A door stands up on its own with nothing around it near one corner of the room. In another corner is a small laptop, with a hard drive plugged in. (Is that enough description? I usually don’t give this much and leave it up to imagination, but now I think this area should be established [is this making it too long? Maybe I should stop typing.])
Jaeger:”Hmm That machine might house Jeffrey” *Goes over to inspect*
It’s…got a lot of tubes, wires, and other things in it, along with a box, which seems to be connected to almost everything else in the system. It appears to be running, but you can’t tell.
Jaeger: “Lets see… Ah, the laptop” *Inspects Laptop*
It’s got the console open, with an unknown language that looks like a mix of C++, Python, Java, Javascript, HTML4, CSS, C#, Kadji, and more. Code seems to be being added
Jaeger: “Alright I’ll call Jake in for this one. Now, onto the corpses!” *Looks at the corpses*
They are corpses of different variations of Ryker. You recognize a couple from different times at SOUR
Jaeger: “Huh, Guess I’ll open the door then. It probably won’t go wrong.” *Opens door*
He opens the door, and as he looks through it, he sees a repaired version of SOUR, Hestuia is standing on the other side of the door, and waves him over
Jaeger: “Give me a minute I need to finish looking around.” *Inspects the hole*
WOOWOWOW HOLLLLEEEEEEEE
Jaeger: “Fine, Hello Hestuia” *Goes through door* 
Dream: “ hi guys.” 
Hestuia: *closes door, and door vanishes* “Hey Jaeger. Nice to meet you. Welcome to past SOUR.”
Dream: “ I have a question.” 
She says to open air.
Jeffrey: “What.”
Dream: “ dang.” * reunites with the others.*
Cancer:*gives dream bonk*
Dream: * trips Cancer.* 
Meanwhile…in the past
Jaeger: “So Past Non-simulation SOUR?”
Hestuia: “Yes. Wait for it……”
Past Ryker: *teleports in* “FINALLY!” *he begins destroying SOUR* “I’m free….!”
Hestuia: *pulls Jaeger 5 inches to the left*
A laser barely misses him
Jaeger: “So… why are you destroying SOUR Ryker?”
Past Ryker: *gives a look at Jaeger* “You’re not supposed to be here yet.” *he gets shoved back to the future*
Back to the future
Jaeger: “Guess I will find Ryker and hope this had no negative effect on the timeline.” *Starts looking for Ryker*
Hestuia: “It didn’t.” *slurps smoothie*
Ryker: * appears.* “ hey.”
Jaeger: “Hey Ryker do you happen to remember a point when you first escaped and started destroying SOUR, did you happen to see me?”
Zane: *makes a cameo* 
Hestuia: “He can’t talk to you right now.”
Jaeger: “Why not?”
Hestuia: “He’s….busy.”
Jaeger: “Doing what?”
Hestuia: “I’d rather not say.”
Jaeger: “Alright then, can you tell me the purpose of visiting old SOUR?”
Hestuia: “Oh, that was to ensure a connection between you and Ryker which will aid me later.”
Jaeger: “Is there anything else to do here in SOUR?”
Hestuia: *sighs* “Life is like a box of chocolates, you never know what you’ll get until you open them.”
Jaeger: “Fine then I will continue to look around.” *Starts going over to finish inspecting the machine and box some more*
Jeffrey: “I wouldn’t do that if I were you.” *it comes from the laptop*
Jaeger: “Ah, there you are.”
Jeffrey: “If you open that box, he’ll become a MUCH worse problem.”
Jaeger: “Then do you have any tips on what I should do?”
Jeffrey: “I’d recommend finding Lyra, but that might be too dangerous for the likes of you..or not. I did once think of you as the…” *gets cut off*
Hestuia: *holding drive* “That’s enough of you.”
Jaeger: “I understand that you are trying to ‘Preserve your future’ but dang it gets annoying but let's go find Lyra.”*Leaves to do what he said.*
Hestuia: “I’d start at the library. R…I mean Librarian, will help you there. She knows where all the members are.”
The Library
Jaeger: “Hello Rae, do you know where Lyra went?”
Librarian: *glares at Jaeger* “I would…” *pauses* “Oh. Hestuia sent you.” *face lets up slightly* “She’s probably in her favorite hiding spot, check in aisle 72, at about elevation 4,289.”
Jaeger: “Thanks, sorry about what happened with the books.” *Goes to aisle 72, at about elevation 4,289*
One of the books is slightly pushed out, as if recently touched. It has no discernable title, but appears as though it was touched recently. Lyra is nowhere to be found.
Jaeger: *Sighs* “Noone is ever there when I need them, anyways what book is this?” *Inspects*
Inside, there appears to have been writing once, however, most of it has been scribbled out and replaced with “Tool” a few lines of text remain, but are too damaged to read.
Jaeger: “Great, we really need to get this ‘Tool’ Problem solved.” *Brings book to librarian* “this is what I found at the location.”
Librarian: *nods* “I expected this…I mean…you could check at Wiziker’s grave…it’s in SOUR, in this small hole behind the throne.””
Jaeger: “Back to SOUR we go!” *Heads to SOUR*
WOW! YOU’RE AT SOUR
Jaeger: “Hello and goodbye Wiziker, well, kinda.” *Inspects grave and around it*
Lyra: *sitting there, motionless*
Ryker: * mumbles “ what happened here?”*
All of a sudden the air begins to feel heavy and then they all begin to feel a chill and the clouds start darkening. (Speaking of which, the weather at SOUR is generally arid at about 64 degrees, with the sun in the sky, depending on how Ryker feels, but has gotten a lot more wild and various since the destruction)
Marckx: *Walks out of door behind them* “no, not yet, whatever you do, do not use your powers when he is here, he is almost here, cover the mirrors.” *Waits* “NOW!”
Lyra: *shaking*
Jaeger: “Alright!” *Covers all of the mirrors*
Hestuia: *frowns* “It doesn’t matter anyway. Everything has reflections.”
Jaeger: “Great, thanks for the help, the only other thing we could do is try to make it pitch black so light cannot reflect off anything.”
A loud cracking sound bursts through sour it is so loud that windows shatter
Then a rift appears but it appears nothing steps threw then the void closes
Void: “Beings of sour! You have someone we are looking for. Surrender the elder or face the consequences.” *The voice is like a whisper but it is heard by all in sour*
Jaeger: “I have no control over Lyra or Marckx but why do you want them?”
Congrats Void, the like five people in SOUR hear you. That’s not too hard.
Ryker: “What Elder?!”
Cancer:*appears*”woah, what's going on, who are you?”*points at void*”you're creepy”
Void: “Marckx, show yourself, you know what I can do”
All of the mirrors begin to ripple
Cancer:”ooooo, pretty, i'm not going to touch it though because it will probably eat me or something. I want to though, so badly”
Void: “I am not kidding, I will do it.”
Cancer:”I don’t know what you can do. Can I know? Because I would like to be prepared to be obliterated or something.”
Marckx: “Void, I have not seen you for years”
Hestuia: “Yeah, can I be an elder?”
Void: “Marckx, surender”
Cancer:”How old are you Hestu?”
Hestuia: “It’s Hestuia. And none of your beezwax.”
Marckx: “Okay” *Kneels down*
Void: *Appears out of the shadows, yet he looks like a tall figure with a pure black guy fox mask*
Cancer:”why are you just surrendering…?”
Lyra: *still quivering, looks straight at Void*
Cancer:*goes over to Lyra, sits down by her, rubs her back.*
???: “Well. Another powerful being, eh? I enjoy powerful beings. Hey, Void, I need a place to rest for a while, mind if I come in?”
Cancer:”I agree. They make better swords.”
Void: *puts hand to ground* “Being of the shadowed light bow down to the darkened power” 
???: “Hmm. I guess you could call me that. Or, like the nerds in Ryker’s head say, ‘Crazy Ryker’”
Cancer:”I bet the sun ate all of your light”
The ground begins to shutter and loose bits of tile begin to be pulled into the mirrors. The ground begins to crack.
Crazy Ryker: *chuckling* “Great.” 
A dark smoke leaks out of Lyras mouth
Cancer:”woah…”*begins floating, floats to the center between all of the mirrors*
Void: “Namin exalo rad nox” *Points at Marckx*
The smoke begins to fill the room, enveloping the entire area
Cancer:*makes wind currents in a doughnut shape with her in the center*
Marckx: “No, do not use your powers on him!” *Grabs onto his robe*
The smoke goes toward Cancer, pushing intensely, ignoring the currents
Cancer:*stops the currents, sits for a second*
The smoke goes directly into her mouth, and she blacks out.
Cancer:*is still floating, blacked out*
Void: *lifts up hand and everything freezes and he begins to absorb all of the power in the room and uses it to pull Marckx into the mirror.*
Unfortunately, it fails. It is electricity, still doesnt wooooooooorkkkkk, Ryker can be annoying, cant he.  
The smoke is floating in place, close to Void, throbbing.
Void: “You, have made a powerful mistake” *Pushes Marckx into a mirror then disappears.*
Hestuia: “It’s an unintentional side effect of Ryker my friend, deal with it.”
A note is left on the floor and it reads: “Hestuia, you can contact us at the start.”
Hestuia: *shrugs* “Okay.” *goes to the start (he knows where it is)*
Meanwhile, In Cancers Head
Crazy Ryker: “You can’t break my tool and expect me not to reciprocate, can you?”
Cancer:”why would you make her a tool then?”
Crazy Ryker: “Oh, I’m breaking you right now. At the moment, your legs are dissolving into puddles.”
Cancer:”okay… and? I don’t see what this accomplishes”
Crazy Ryker: “Revenge.”
Cancer:”okay. Revenge is sweet isn’t it?”
Crazy Ryker: “Eh, could be sweeter, like caramel candy, which is actually…” *he trails off on a tangent on caramel candies*
Cancer:*summons caramel sucker and jams it into his mouth.*
Meanwhile, not in Cancer’s head
Jaeger: “Crazy Ryker, what do you want this time?”
Meanwhile, back to Cancer’s head
Crazy Ryker: * around sucker*“Revenge.”
jeb: “ on who? I just got here.”
Jeb: “ oh okay”
Jeb: “So how is it going?”
Cancer:”WHAT ARE YOU ALL DOING IN MY HEAD!? I sure hope that their isn’t an AI in my head, so what are you all doing in my head? Only crazy ryker is in my head right now. Shoo.”
Dream: “ I'm here too.” 
Cancer:”how are you here? I’m very unconscious and only crazy ryker is in my head. So if you are going to be here. Shush.”
Dream: “ NO! You can’t make me shush. I'll be as loud as I wish.” * steals that one flute that Cancer found in the vents of S.O.U.R that one time.* 
At the start
When Hestuia walks in, he sees a large lobby and when he looks up it seems as if it stretches on forever. In the front and center there is a statue of 5 people all holding a staff with different symbols on them.
Aios: “Welcome to New [REDACTED], I am glad you were able to get here.”
A small sound like someone hitting a crystal with a metal rod is played and a bunch of different people begin to walk out of doors and begin to head to different elevators except they are clearly not human.
Aios: “Sorry, everybody is trying to head to the cross roads.”
Hestuia: *shrugs* “So, where do you want me?”
Aios: “Oh yes, first you are here for trial, I need you to put on this band.” *Holds up band with strange symbols on it.*
Hestuia: *raises eyebrows* “What does it do? Is it a symbol of recognition? Or something more?”
Aios: “It is both, It lets elders know not to instantly kill you, and it is a band of restriction, it is to make sure that you will not use your powers until the test.”
Hestuia: “I apologize for the questions. I had to ask them.” *puts on band*
He feels a strange sensation running through him and then he completely loses his foresight
Aios: “I understand you are blind, so I will have you where this” *Hands him strange looking glasses.*
Hestuia: “I find that glasses tend to not work on me. Even your ‘special’ ones.” *pauses* “Just continue. I’m capable on my own.”
Aios: “No, these are not to help you vision, it is to make sure that when you pass through one of our security devices, you do not lose your other senses.” 
Hestuia: *sighs in discontent, and puts on glasses* “I still do not approve of these unnatural objects.”
Aios: “Trust me, it is better than losing you hearing also” *pauses* “follow me” *Begins to walk to a lift.*
Hestuia: *does so* “So how many people…pass.”
Aios: “Well, it depends” *Pulls lever in elevator and it begins to descend* “This is more of a deciding of whether or not it is possible.” *pulls other lever and the lift begins to move to the left* “You see, elders are born, but void thinks there is another way, we will just have to see if he is right.” *The lift come to a stop* “Right this way, I need you to step through the door on the left. I must go a different way.”
Hestuia: *nods respectfully and steps through the left door, smiling* “See ya later.”
The room is empty with only a small button in the center. A voice comes on saying: “Please press the button if you accept our conditions of meeting.”
Hestuia: “I mean, that depends. What are the conditions?”
Intercom: “You must agree to leave when the council says, you must agree to allow the council to monitor your thought during the meeting, and you must agree to allow us to temporarily show you some of their thoughts. Do you agree?”
Hestuia: “All right.” *presses button*
The room melts away and then he is standing in front of a committee of 5 people 3 he does not recognize and 2 of them are Aios and Void
???: “Void why did you call us here so early”
Void: “Kangae, I called you here because, Hestuia would like to become an elder”
Kangae: “This again!”
Void: “No, just hear me out, you know it is possible.”
Kangae: “It is unsafe, we are protectors!”
Void: “He is the one. He can show you!”
Aios: “If I might say, why don’t we just ask.”
Kangae: “I agree”
Aios: “Why do you want to be an elder, do not try to lie, just relax and tell us why.”
Hestuia: *sighs* “To ensure my future.”
Void: “Am I right or not?”
Kangae: “That does not mean anything.”
Aios: “May I do a simple test on you? I promise it will not take long.”
Hestuia: *nods* “I warn you, I know the exact right things to do in any test you could give me. So if I do something different, there’s a reason.”
Aios: “This is not a test that can be altered, no matter how hard you try, you are not the only one with that gift in history.”
Hestuia: *raises eyebrows* “Oh, them.”
Aios: *Chuckles* “JUst trust me, know matter how hard you try to alter this, there is only one possible way and you would not do that.”
Hestuia: “If you check my memory, you’ll see I already know this fact.”
Kangae: *Nods* “Proceed”
Aios: “Marckx, you may come in”
Marckx: *Walks through door he is in strange hand cough* “Hold out your hand please.”
Hestuia: *does so, smiling*
Marckx: *Begins to whisper and a strange symbol appears*
Aios: “He is marked with it, you are wrong”
Kangae: “You are right, void it is not possible”
Void: “There is another way…”
???: “Void, don’t even suggest it”
Void: “Orka, it would work, and you know it!”
Orka: “I will not participate if you do this”
Aios: “I mean, it could work”
Kangae: “I do not like it, but it would work”
Void: “I can speak for myself now, Hestuia, there is a way, there is a spell from the very beginning of the first elders. Would you be willing to make a trade?”
Hestuia: “Of course.”
Void: “Then it is a deal” *All of the elders step down from there seats and surround Hestuia*
Kangae: “This spell can only be cast 2 more times. If we do this, you must be prepared to listen to every word.”
Hestuia: *clears throat* “Three.”
Void: “I mean you are not wrong, but the last one will be used for something else.” *Pauses* “ Lets begin”
The elders form a circle around Hestuia and all press their hands to the ground
Void: “Being of the light and dark hear our words!” *They all suddenly seem to be in sync* “Magic of the old days shall bind you, Magic of the new age shall break you, Magic of time shall be with you, If you continue you will be bound to the agreement, if it is broken, you shall fall. You will protect the timeline, you will heed our words, in return, you will be linked to the palace of the start. One last warning if you move forward, you will be linked to an object. If it is destroyed, all is unravel , do you agree…” *looks behind him*
Hestuia: *bored* “I do indeed.”
Collective: “It is done” *They wave their hands and a piece of paper appears with his signature on it.*
The room begins to shake and Hestuia begins float into the air
Marckx: *Grabs onto the paper right before the spell finishes and infuses it with power*
The spell is complete now
Void: “Welcome to the elders” *Does not seem to notice that the contract was slightly altered* “You must take the contract and the object you would like to bind it to then set them both on fire. Do you have an object in mind?”
Hestuia: “Well since I’m already bonded to an object, yes.”
Void: “What object, I also have to so a small spell so it will bond correctly”
Hestuia: *pulls out a TV remote, although it seems to appear* “This.” 
A strong link can be felt between Hestuia and the remote, stronger than what the elders appear to have.
Kangae: “That connection, is so strong,” *Picks up the remote and begins to whisper a small but powerful spell to it*
The remote and the paper burst into black flame and then the objects turn to ash and reform together as the remote but now it has another button on it
Kangae: “The bond is complete.”
Hestuia falls over as a rush of power surges through him
Hestuia: *quickly makes the remote vanish before he falls over*
Kangae: “You must be careful, you chose a rather dangerous binding object, as you use any of your power, it will now draw from the fragment of the start which is linked to the batteries.”
Hestuia: *smiles sarcastically* “Don’t worry, I have plenty of double A batteries.”
Void: “I am afraid you must leave now, we must recharge after such a big spell.”
Hestuia: *frowns* “All right. Be watchful for the time of demise!” *he vanishes in a puff of smoke, as the band clatters to the ground, with an odd symbol carved into it*
Meanwhile.
Dream: “ ok im bored.” * leaves Cancer's mind.* 
Jeb: “ Who is cancer?”
Dream: “ that person.” * points to Cancer.* 
Inside Cancer’s mind
Cancer:”So are you just going to sit here and try to torcher me for your ‘revenge’ or are you actually going to do something.”
Jeb: “ I dont know?” * ceases to exist any more*
Kris:” “
Suddenly a brick flies through the window and misses Hestuia 
In new [REDACTED]
Void: “Where did you put that book?”
Aios: “Found it”
Void: “Marckx, please read it allowed”
Marckx: *Does nothing*
Void: “Obey ME.”
Marckx: “Now why would I do that” *Holds up Hands and the devices are off of him* “Good bye” *Grabs a book and disappears.*
Hestuia: *appears once again* “I could read it…”
Void: *Looks enraged*
Aios: “That book contained the spell didn’t it.”
Void: “Yes it did contain the spell”
Kris: “...”
Dream: “ Well shoot.” 
Hestuia: *presses new button on remote*
Dream: “ oooooooooh can I press buttons?!”
Kris: “...”
Hestuia: *glares at Dream* “No.”
Dream: * tries to push buttons anyway.* 
Cancer:*appears*”buttons are good for pushing.”*grins*
Meanwhile, in Lyras head
Lyra: “You can’t make me do ANYTHING!”
Crazy Ryker: “Of course I can. If you weren’t so snoopy, you wouldn’t of had to deal with me.”
Lyra: “I was checking to see if an enemy was nearby. Which there was!”
Crazy Ryker: “No. There wasn’t. You removed me from my home. I was comfortable where I was before YOU interfered. Now I can’t even go back. They replaced me.”
Lyra: *scoffs* “Well you deserved it.”
Crazy Ryker: “Bahh!”
Lyra: “Now leave. I don’t want you here, and you don’t want to be here. So go. Find someone else to annoy.”
Crazy Ryker: “Fine. On one condition.”
Lyra: “What?”
Crazy Ryker: “You become my TOOL!”
Lyra: “no.”
Crazy Ryker: “It’s too late for that, you already have lost most of your control.”
Lyra:  “No!”
Crazy Ryker: “Yes! Now surrender, and I may spare you.”
Lyra: *weaker* “No!”
Crazy Ryker: *pushes her over* “Surrender. You’re more useful to me ALIVE.”
Lyra: *faintly* “N…o!”
Crazy Ryker: “You can’t stop me. Surrender or perish.”
Lyra: “I..I…I…”
Crazy Ryker: “Yea?”
Lyra: *sighs* “Surrender.” *she collapses on the ground*
Crazy Ryker: “Ha! Finally! To control a body…I’ve missed you! Now…to get my body back.”
Suddenly, “Lyra” appears in front of Ryker, swirling in shadow and light
Lyra: “Well you seem different.” *pauses* “Oh. I see…. Come on Arson. Just throw Bob out. He’s not important.”
Meanwhile…in Rykers head (yes, Arsons been in control for a while :] )
Head Ryker: “ARSON! GIVE ME CONTROL! I can stop him!”
Bob: *slurps smoothie* “Hmm. So that’s Crazy eh?”
Hyper Ryker: “Yep,thatsCrazy,Ikindalikedhim,butheseemsmoresanerightnow.Iguessyearswithoutdealingwithrykerwilldothattoyou.”
Evil Ryker: “I can appreciate a good evil plot, but DANG! has he been stewing on this for years?”
Meta Ryker: “Took you long enough THE Author.”
Good Ryker: “We have to stop him.”
Pirate Ryker: “Argggh! Baton the hatches, release the cannons! Burn the invader.”
Lazy Ryker: “Arson’s nice. He’s fine in control. He’ll handle it.”
Lawnmower Ryker: “Somow mow I mowbt that.”
Jeffrey: “Huh. I never knew I had access to your head.”
Tech Ryker: “Yeah, he installed it the other day. He blocked downloads though.”
Envious Ryker: “Why does HE get access to cyan?”
Factual Ryker: “Cause he’s from the real world.”
Technicality Ryker: “Well, technically, Head Ryker is only in Rykers head and HE’S cyan.”
Patriotic Ryker: “WHOOOOO! REALLECT HEAD RYKER FOR BRAIN DICTATOR!”
Actor Ryker: “MY FIRST SPEAKING ROLE!”
Evil Ryker: “ALL OF YOU SHUT UP!”
Lawnmower Ryker: “Mow? Wmy?”
Evil Ryker: “I SAID SHUT UP! Arson. Just let Crazy in.”
Arson: “ No! Are you Crazy?!”* looks at Head Ryker.* “ I-I don't know. I have no idea what I'm doing! I can’t use any of your stupid powers, And everyones shouting at me!”
Head Ryker: “Just let me take control.”
Meanwhile, not in Ryker’s head
Kris: “...”
Cancer:”hi.”*hi fives kris’ face*
Kris “...” * is unaffected*
Hestuia: “Huh, already?”
Cancer:”what.”
Hestuia: “...”
Cancer:*pokes Hestuia”
Kris: “...” *selects the act option*
Hestuia: “Hmmm…” *the act options are…ask for your future, or ignore*
Cancer:”this is very weird. It’s like a video game, and I'm not even sure what a video game is.”
Kris: * uses conversation*
Hestuia: “Hello, I’m Hestuia, I foresee the future. You can’t hurt me.” *his head moves back and forth idley*
Kris: *uses spare*
Hestuia: *doesn’t accept spare* “Are you ready to rumble?”
Kris: * uses  stick which instantly spares hestia *
Hestuia: “I do like sticks…..don’t tell anyone.” *spared: You gain 10xp and 5 gold*
Kris: *begins to listen to bergentruckung*
Hestuia: *stands idly*
Cancer:*pokes kris*
Kris: *is unresponsive*
Marckx: *Appears next to them.* “Hey, Hestuia would you mind helping me with something?”Jaeger: “Ryker, how long have you been sitting here and, is Arson in control?”
Kirs: “...”
Jaeger: “I am going to take that as a yes for the second one considering you are not responding.”
Kris: “...”
Jaeger: *Waves hand in front of Ryker’s face*
Ryker: “MOW!”
Jaeger: *Slowly Raises Eyebrow*
Kris: “...”
Meanwhile…in Rykers head
Arson: * stressed.* “ I-I don’t know what to do.”
Head Ryker: “Either stop him from getting into the mindscape or give me control.” 
Arson: “ ok.” * gives Head Ryker the control.* 
Head Ryker: *snatches the controls from Arson, then glares at him* “You shut down most of our powers. We’ve got no defense…”
Outside
Lyra: “No blockage? This is weak, even for you Ryker. All right then.” *the mist swirls out of Lyra*
Jaeger: “What are you planning to do Crazy?”
The mist shakes, and attempts to go into Ryker, but fails
Lyra: *teleports away before she can be taken again*
The mist becomes restless and begins looking for a host it can go into, bolting straight into Jaeger
Jaeger: “I must warn you I have built up quite the mental fortitude over the time I spent with myself alone and there are two of me in this head, so be ready.”
Crazy Ryker: “Mental Fortitude…yeah good luck with that.”
Jaeger: “I’m patient enough, I did wait for a LONG time after all.”
Crazy Ryker: *scoffs* “I have been patient for MUCH longer.”
Cancer:*vanishes, keeping a tag on them all*
Jaegers Mind
Crazy Ryker: “Heeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeerrrrrrrrrrrrrreeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee’s CRAZY RYKER!”
Jaeger: “Hello Crazy.” 
Crazy Ryker sees a black void with the controls unprotected with Jaeger sitting in a chair sipping tea not even in control or concerned. The void seems to be filled with information seemingly looking like bookshelves. Jaeger is not even trying to protect the controls from Crazy Ryker.
Jaeger: “I have decided that instead of trying to fight you I would try a more… diplomatic approach, the reason My mindscape looks like this is because after the.. Incident I have never been the same.”
Crazy Ryker: “Your head is boooooooooooooooooooooooorrring.”
Jaeger: “Just the way I like it, I could let you remodel most of it as long as I get to keep a small section the way it is.”
Crazy Ryker: “UGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGHHHHHHHH! NO!” *leaves head*
Smoke Escapes in a dense cloud, and attempts to go into Ryker again, which fails.
Ryker: *captures smoke in a bottle*
Crazy Ryker: “NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!”
Ryker: *yeets him into a pocket dimension, to banish him*
Lyra: *reappears* “Thanks Ryker.”
Cancer:*reappears*”I didn’t wish to be possessed again.”
Joe: “ I'm in the wrong story ” *Dies*
Cancer:”what was he even doing here in the first place?”
Jaeger: “Looking for revenge.”
Cancer:”okay. Why was he looking for revenge?”
Dream: * shrugs.* 
Lyra: *looks around and seems to relax*
Ryker: “Well that was anticlimactic.”
Hestuia: *raises eyebrow* “Right.”
Lyra: “So. What do we do now?”
Hestuia: *smiles* “Don’t worry, I’ve started the next part to our story…”
Ryker: “It feels good to be back in control”
Hestuia: “And, someone else’s story is just beginning.”
Meanwhile: In a lab in [Redacted]
?????: *groans* “Who? Where am I?”
A Speaker turns on
Speaker: “IT WORKED! It actually worked!”
Another Voice on the Speaker: “I told you I was good.”
Speaker 1: “But hacking into the old SOUR system?”
Speaker 2: “I TOLD you.”
?????: “Could someone please explain where and who I am?”
Speaker 1: “Welcome. My name is…” *whispers* “Catrina. You’ve signed up for testing and mind wiping. Lucky you!”
?????: “But what’s my name?”
Catrina: “We’re not allowed to disclose that information, however, for the length of the testing, we will call you One.”
One: “Am I the first then?”
Catrina: “Yet again, not at leisure to disclose that.”
One: “Well why me?”
Catrina: “Not allowed..”
One: “To disclose that. Yeah, yeah. But who’s your friend up there?”
Catrina: “Want to introduce yourself?”
Speaker 2: “Relish in awe of the amazing hacker, alpha coder, master of all that is tech…”
Catrina: “Alright Kyle, shut up.”
Kyle: “Hey! You ruined my intro!”
Catrina: “Anyways…go ahead and rest up. You’ll be here for a while.”
A small bed, side table, and a couple of other amenities rise up from the ground.
One: “I can’t sleep now!”
Catrina: “Oh? So you wish to start the testing?”
One: *shrugs* “Sure.”
Catrina: “Then let’s begin.” *the room becomes empty once again* “For your first test, we are inserting a life form into the room. Do with it as you will.” *from a panel wall, a small spider pops out*
One: *instantly crushes it* “I hate spiders.”
Catrina: “Right.”
Kyle: “That’s what I would have done.”
Catrina: “Not helping.”
Kyle: “I don’t see why you wanted him anyway.”
Catrina: *sighs* “Not in front of the subject.”
Kyle: “Not like he knows what we’re talking about. He’s just a kid.”
Catrina: “Right. One, we’re going to…”
A small bit of smoke slips through some of the gaps in the panels, and goes into One.
Catrina: “D…did you see that Kyle?”
Kyle: “What? The smoke?”
Catrina: “Yeah…did you do that?”
Kyle: “No. I thought you did.”
Catrina: “It wasn’t me.”
One: “What happened.”
One hears
???: “Why, how INTERESTING! I wasn’t expecting this!”
One: “Who are you!”
???: “I’m your consciousness.”
One: “Well that’s obviously false.”
Catrina: “Hey kid! Why are you talking to yourself.”
One: “Wait. You don’t hear the voice? This isn’t some sort of sick test?”
Kyle: “Not one I programmed.”
Catrina: “We’ll I guess we’re testing something else then.”
Kyle: *sighs* “I’ll get to programming.”
Catrina: “All right One, you can just take a break, enjoy yourself.”
The bedroom reappears, along with a small TV, and a Xtendo Disney video game console. There is also a computer with some games on it and a basketball court.
Kyle: “We’ll see you in a bit.”
The Speaker System turns off
Dream: * appears in the room, invisible.*  
You look at One…and realize it’s Young Ryker
Y Ryker: *turns on TV.*
It begins playing a NewZoob video, titled: Simulation Ryker’s Timeline: Explained
NewZoob Guesser: “Right. So we know that Sim Ryker had two different backstories: The Aiolos One, and the Multiversal Gem One. Let’s begin with the Aiolos origin. According to the season finale…” *It continues showing snippets of Ryker, and the guy continues explaining the timeline.*
Y Ryker: *watches, somewhat interested* “Huh. That’s interesting.” *he doesn’t seem to remember any of the events that took place, and seems slightly intrigued with the Young Ryker in the video, but Young Ryker appears about 4 years younger than him, and he doesn’t recognize it*
NewZoob Guesser: “But that’s just a guess….a TV SHOW GUESS! THANKS FOR LISTENING AND DON’T FORGET TO LICK AND SUBSCRIB!”
Y Ryker: *goes down a rabbit hole of Roleplay conspiracy videos, intently interested* “I should probably watch the show first, but eh.” *gets bored after about 5 minutes* “Well now what?” *he looks through some drawers and finds a an Ouija board and a chess board* “Huh. All right. Let’s play chess with myself.” *begins to play chess, leaving the Ouija board out*
Dream: * still invisible, moves one of the pawns forward.* 
Y Ryker: *flinches, then responds by moving a pawn* “Hello? Is that you conscious?”
Dream: * giggles and takes another turn.*
Y Ryker: *continues playing* “Hello?”
Dream: * takes another turn, purposefully breaking the rules to see what he will do.* 
Y Ryker: *shrugs, and decides to move one of his pieces in the same way* “Check.”
Dream: * picks up queen and knocks over all pawns surrounding the king even though it’s against the rules then places it back in its spot. Giggles.* 
Y Ryker: *flips board in rage* “THAT’S CHEATING!”
Dream: * laughs.* “ I know.” 
Y Ryker: “What’s so funny.”
Dream: “ your anger.”
Y Ryker: “I’m assuming you’re some kind of test.”
Dream: “ no.” 
Y Ryker: “Well what are you then?”
Dream: “ a friend.” 
Y Ryker: “If You’re such a friend, what’s my name, huh?”
Dream: “ Well I know your real name but everyone here calls you One.” 
Y Ryker: “And What’s your name ‘friend’”
Dream: “ I call myself Dream.” 
Y Ryker: “Like the one from the TV show?”
Dream: “ no.” 
Y Ryker: “Okay. So why are you here?”
Dream: “ Like I said, you're my friend, or you used to be.” 
Y Ryker: “So you’d let me out of…”
The speaker turns on
Catrina: “Who ya talking to One?”
Y Ryker: “The invisible voice that cheated at chess.”
Catrina: “Right.” 
It shuts off
Y Ryker: “…let me out of here?”
Dream: “ sure.” 
Y Ryker: “Well do it Then.”
Dream: * tries to teleport them back to the rest of the group.* 
Y Ryker: *recognizes them all from the TV show* “Liar.”
Dream: “ what do you mean?” 
Y Ryker: “You're all from the TV show.”
Rae: “ Dream, what did you do?”
Dream: * turns visible.* “ why is it that when I try to actually do something important everyone gets mad?” 
Y Ryker: “Hi Rae. I’m a fan.” *reaches out to shake hands*
Rae: * accepts his handshake.* “ uhhh thanks.”  
Dream: “ oh by the way he doesn’t remember who he is.”
Y Ryker: “You know who I am?”
Rae: * nods.* 
Y Ryker: “So who am I?”
Rae: “ your Ryker.” 
Arson: * in Rykers head.* “ Ryker!” 
Ryker: “You want out?”
Arson: “ yes!” 
Ryker: *grabs a bottle, and a black-orange smoke comes out of his mouth, and he hands it to Y Ryker* 
Y Ryker: “I’m Ryker? But…he’s Ryker. And what’s with the bottle of orange-black smoke?” *opens it up*
Rae: “ Well did you know you're a paradox?” 
Y Ryker: *blinks* “No.”
The smoke begins to form into Arsons shape
Arson: “ finally! FREEDOM!” 
Y Ryker: “And who’s he?”
Dream: “ That's Arson.” 
Y Ryker: “As in starting a fire?”
Dream: “ yup.”
Arson: * mutters.* “ you named me.”
Y Ryker: “Well I think it’s a pretty cool name.” 
Arson: “ thanks.” 
Y Ryker: “And this is the new character Lyra, right?” *points to Lyra*
Lyra: “Yeah.”
Y Ryker: *looks around* “So if I’m a Ryker, does that mean I can fly like him?”
Dream: “ probably.” 
Y Ryker: *jumps, and falls on his face*
Dream: “ Well you have to learn how to use your powers first.”
Y Ryker: “So how?”
Dream: “ Rae, your turn.”
Rae: “ Why me?” 
Y Ryker: *shrugs*
Dream: “ I dunno. You were the first person I could think of.” 
Y Ryker: “So what do you know, Rae?”
Cancer:*does weird waddle walk over very quickly*”hi.”*waddle walks away very quickly and starts floating upside down and begins loop-de-looping over them all.*
Y Ryker: “Well…okay Then.”
Cancer:*falls and faceplants, stays rigid*
Dream: * pokes her.* 
Y Ryker: “Umm…Rae?”
Rae: “ yeah.” 
Y Ryker: “How do I fly?”
Rae: “ uhhhhhhhh… well the question is do you hear the sounds?”
Y Ryker: “What sounds?”
Rae: “ chime like noises that come from everyone.” 
Y Ryker: “What’s it sound like?”
Rae: “ if you hear them you’ll know.” 
Y Ryker: “Well I guess I don’t have powers.”
Rae: “ You do. I’ve seen them. It just takes time.” 
Y Ryker: “Prove it.”
Rae: “ it took me about 15 years to understand the full extent of my powers.” 
Y Ryker: “I doubt that. Prove it.”
Rae: “ I can’t really. You’ll just have to take my word for it.” 
Y Ryker: “Hmmm.”
Ryker: “Ask them if they hear the ringing. Cause they don’t.”
Y Ryker: “They don’t? But it helps…”
Ryker: “With knowing if people are there. Yes.”
Rae: “ I hear them.” 
Y Ryker: “Well now what?”
Dream: “ We could start fires!”
Rae: “ .. yeah let’s not do that.” 
Y Ryker: “How!”
Dream: * reaches into pocket and pulls out matches.* “ Here kid, have some matches.” 
Y Ryker: “YAY!” *he sets Dream on fire, and begins walking toward Hestuia*
Hestuia: “No.” *he vanishes*
Dream: “ yay! Fire!” * continues to be on fire. Starts lighting other stuff on fire.* 
Arson: “ YES!!!” * joins in the chaos.* 
Y Ryker: “YAAAAAAAAAAY!” *he lights Arson on fire*
Arson: * burn more stuff.*
Rae: “ guys! Why?!” 
Y Ryker: “Why not?” *lights Rae on fire*
Rae: * puts ALL of the fire out and takes the matches.* “ because it’s not good.”
Dream: “ but I like fire.”
Arson: “ yeah! I say we vote!” 
Y Ryker: “Yeah!”
Hestuia: *invisible* “How about not.”
Rae: “ yeah, no. We’re not a democracy.” 
Ryker: “I vote no fire.”
Rae: “ no! You don’t get fire!”
Dream: * lights hand on fire.* “ I get fire.” 
Jaeger: *Appears and puts out fires* “Stop, all of you, young Ryker, are there other people in here?”
Y Ryker: “Hestuia.”
Dream: * lights fire.* “ make me stop.” 
Y Ryker: *frowns* “I don’t have fire…”
Cancer:*gets up and walks over*”Fire is good. I manipulate energy, it’s how I learn powers. Fire is super easy. You just make everything vibrate really fast I guess.”
Y Ryker: “But how?” *shakes hand like a normal human being*
Cancer:”kinda with your mind I guess. You make what you're working with excited in order to light it on fire. Try making this stick excited.”*a stick appears sticking straight up out of the ground.”
Ryker: “Here watch…” *suddenly Y Ryker feels like he’s watching from Ryker’s perspective* “All you have to do is…” *he listens to a frequency from Arson, focuses on it, and lights his hand on fire* “Easy.” *disconnects from Y Ryker*
Y Ryker: “Alright?”
Cancer:”try”*smiles*
Y Ryker: *listens to Arson, and focuses intently on him, and lights his hand on fire*
Ryker: “Now just remember the frequency and you can use it whenever.”
Y Ryker: *throws fireballs around*
Hey, BTW we’re in the void
Cancer:”good job. Now to learn every other frequency that you can hear i guess…”
Y Ryker: “Umm…”
Ryker: “Here…start with this.” *he lets out a frequency*
Y Ryker: *copies it*
Ryker: “Congrats, you just got infinite memory. Now, time for superspeed.” *emits another signal*
Y Ryker: *copies it*
5 milliseconds later
Y Ryker: “FINALLY! THAT TOOk FOREEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEVVVVVVVVVVVVVVER.”
Cancer:”ummm. ok”*slows down Y Ryker’s particles*
Y Ryker: “So now I can do a BUNCH of things.”
Cancer:”yes. You can”
Jaeger: “Young Ryker do you recall anyone else being in here other than you before any of us arrived?” 
Y Ryker: “Not really, why?”
Jaeger: “It is kind of suspicious that, before we were in the void, you were in what looked like a room for test subjects.”
Y Ryker: *shrugs*
Cancer:”I’m going to believe him, and yeah, that is kinda weird. I wonder if there are like, higher ryker’s or something testing him. That would be really weird.”
Jaeger: “Dream you were here before all of us, did you hear anything?”
Kris “...”
Y Ryker: “I feel like you don’t trust me Jaeger. We had dodecahedron together.”
Cancer:”I am concerned about what dodecahedron is. Very concerned. And also, he probably doesn’t”
Kris: “...”
Random text bubble:  “ how do you have a noun with someone?”
Dream: “ I remember lots of things. It depends on what you want.” 
Cancer:”I want to know what the room looks like and where it was. I don’t know what Jaeger wants.”
Dream: “ Well I wasn’t listening until after I heard my name soooo….” 
Y Ryker: *pulls up a projection of the room, shifting it between its various states* “This help?”
Dream: “ oh that place. I didn’t see anyone.” 
Jaeger: “We did have Dodecahedron together and I do trust you. I just thought there might be something in there because it looked suspicious.” 
Dream: “ what’s a Dod-a .. Dodecahr-edron.” 
Y Ryker: “It’s basically a meal of the day.”
Dream: “ oh.” 
Y Ryker: “Yeah. It’s after dinner, but before breakfast. And Jaeger, I mean there were two people on the speaker system.”
Dream: “ wait! How did Jaeger know that?” 
Y Ryker: *shrugs*
Cancer:*shrugs as well*
Dream: “ Ryker, do you want to play chess again?” 
Ryker: “I’d play chess.”
Y Ryker: “You cheat.”
Dream: “ your point?” 
Ryker: *summons three dimensional chess* “Wanna play. I learned it from Jean Luc.”
Dream: “ ok.” 
Ryker: *moves a piece* “All right. Tell me, how often do you cheat at chess?”
Dream: * immediately cheats.* “ Does that answer your question?” 
Ryker: *nods* “Yes.” *her king falls over* “Oh. You lose.”
Dream: * just puts it back up and uses it to obiverate half his pawns.* “ lol nope.” 
Ryker: “Oh, of course, you’re playing the controversial 1963 addition.” *He knocks over the rest of her pieces*
Dream: * uses her king to knock over all the other pawns.* 
Ryker: *raises eyebrows* “Oh, well I guess you win. Too bad.”
Dream: “ cool! Little Ryker, wanna play?” 
Y Ryker: “No!” *folds arm*
Dream: “ Come on. It will be fun.” 
Cancer:”yeah, that made no sense. But then again, they don’t make any sense just about ever. ”
Y Ryker: “NO!”
Dream: “ YES!”
Y Ryker: “You can’t make me. Ha.” 
Dream: “ I know.” 
Y Ryker: *sticks out his tongue, and teases Dream* “HA!”
Dream: * teases him back.* 
Cancer:*steals tongue*
Y Ryker: *Squeals, when she tries and pulls out his tongue* “Sahp!”
Cancer:*jams it back into his face*
Y Ryker: *starts crying* “Why!?”
Dream: * glares at Cancer.* “ Don't you touch my Ryker!!” * punches cancer in face.* 
Cancer:*ducks*”oi!! He’s a ryker, he can learn as well as any of ‘em.”*floats above them, upside down*
Dream: “ no one gets to hurt little Ryker!” * attacks her.* 
Y Ryker: *bawling*
Cancer:*dodges*”Well then fix the bawling if you're so worried about him.”*floats higher*
Dream: * still manages to attack Cancer.* “ NO!” 
Cancer:”are you going insane again? If you are soooo worried about him, go make him better. In fact, I will make him better because you will not.”*floats down and gives Y Ryker a basket of candy*”I am sorry for stealing your tongue, will you accept my gift of candy?”
Y Ryker: “No.”
Cancer:”okay. Is there anything else that you would like?”
Y Ryker: “No.”
Cancer:”well I am sorry for stealing your tongue.”*pulls out her bottle of mist and continues tinkering with it*
It appears to be gravitating to Y Ryker
Dream: “ Do you want to play a game?” 
Y Ryker: “No.” *he seems upset*
Dream: “ ok.’’ 
Cancer:*tinkers with the mist, it seems to reject everyone, even Cancer a little bit.*
It continues attempting to go toward Y Ryker
Dream: * begins to draw.* 
Ryker: *watches in curiosity*
Dream: * sketches something he can't see, then waves her hand over and it's gone , she draws some more.* 
the mist disappears from the bottle,the bottle is released, flies towards ryker, and goes straight into his mouth
Dream: “ well frick.” 
Cancer:”have fun eating glass”
Y Ryker: “What? Is it the smoke? Cause it looked like the stuff that went in my mouth before. Does that not happen to you?”
Dream: “ Well I'm not sure what it does but it concerns me.” 
Y Ryker: *shrugs* “What were you drawing?”
Dream: * doesn't answer. She continues to sketch out another figure this one looks to be in almost the same as the other just in a slightly different position. But he can't see it well enough to tell what it is.* 
Y Ryker: *annoyed* “Tell me!!!”
Dream: * giggles.* “ You can't make me. Ha.” 
Cancer:”no, it is mist, not smoke, and it isn’t the smoke that went into your mouth, that smoke was Crazy Ryker. This mist doesn’t have any consciousness.”
Dream: * swipes her hand and the sketch is gone. She starts on a third.* 
Y Ryker: *shrugs* “Okay.” *he snatches the sketch, halfway through her drawing it*
There's nothing on it. 
Y Ryker: *frustrated* “AH!”
Dream: * laughs and takes it back. The drawing is there again but he still can't see it very well.* 
Hestuia: *sighs in annoyance* “Can’t we just leave him again?”
Cancer:”leave little ryker behind? I don’t have any issue with that. Dream might though.”
Dream: “ No. We’re not leaving little Ryker.”
Y Ryker: “My name is Ryker!”
Dream: “ your point?”
Arson: “ hey Dream? Can I see your drawing?”
Dream: “ sure.” * gives him the sketch.* 
Y Ryker: “DON’T CALL ME LITTLE RYKER!”
Cancer:”but you are small, buddy”
Y Ryker: *refuses to talk to Cancer*
Dream: “ aww but it's fun.” 
Y Ryker: *glares at Dream*
Dream: “ ok.” * takes sketch book back and continues to draw.* 
Y Ryker: *mumbling about Potato Chips?*
Dream: * pays no attention, she makes a few more drawings then clicks something and the drawing begins to move. It's an animation.* 
Wiziker: *appears* “Hey.” *disappears*
Y Ryker: “What was that?”
Dream: “ Wiziker.” 
Cancer:”and what was he trying to accomplish?”
Y Ryker: *shrugs* “I’m only like 10.”
Dream: “ I'm 12. I'm older.” 
Cancer:”Well that explains your attitude.”
Y Ryker: *glares at Cancer*
Cancer:”what?”
Y Ryker: *starts bawling* “Cancer bullied me in my mind! She’s being mean!” *he sniffles*
Dream: * glares at Cancer.* 
Cancer:”what.”*floats upside down some more*
Ryker: *glares at Cancer*
Cancer:”and? So you think that I am talking to you in your mind. You really shouldn't take advantage of your powers.”
Y Ryker: “She’s being mean!” *he begins to cry, louder*
Cancer:*ears vanish floats higher*
Y Ryker: *sobs* “W…hy are you so mean!?”
Dream: “ It's ok Ryker.” 
Cancer:”I do not understand what he is trying to accomplish. If you want me to leave ryker, you can just say it. I don’t see why you need to blame me”
Y Ryker: *he flinches* “OW! STOP IT!”
Cancer:*sighs*”I think that Wiziker or somebody is hurting him. I am not doing anything”
Dream: “ well he seems pretty mad at you
Cancer:”and I think that is why he is blaming me. I think that someone else is hurting him and he’s blaming me because he’s mad at me.”
Y Ryker: *screams in pain* “STOP IT CANCER!”
Cancer:”See, he is obviously in pain, and I am not doing anything.”
Arson: “ Cancer! Stop!” 
Cancer:”I AM NOT DOING ANYTHING!!!! WHAT!! SO!! EVER!!”
Y Ryker: *falls down on the floor, screaming*
Arson: * tries to take away the pain.* 
Y Ryker: *screams louder* “STOP!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!”
Arson: * stops.*
Cancer:”I think that something is going after him. The mist from the people?”
Kyle: “Nope. Not ours.” *standing there* “Now give us Ryker back please.”
Dream: “ No!” 
Cancer:”Well then who else? You previously trapped him. I don’t think that you are going to get ryker. We aren’t going to let you”*stands between her and Ryker*
Kyle: *shrugs, and vanishes*
Cancer:”she is going to bite us in the butt.”
Kris: “…”
Y Ryker: *writhes on the floor, curled up in a ball*
Kris: “…”
Cancer:*tries to read his mind*
There are large fortifications, almost as strong as Ryker’s.
Cancer:”Dream, can you see anything?”
Dream: * tries to read his mind.* 
Still fails
Dream: “ nope.” 
kris
Cancer:”well how do we fix this”*gestures at the writhing ryker.”
Ryker: *watching, not saying anything*
Y Ryker: *exclaims loudly* “OW! STOP!”
Arson: “ wait! Why am I not in pain too?” 
Cancer:”because he’s been in custody and they have probably changed things.”
Ryker: “You’re linked to me. Not him.”
Arson: “ But how? I'm part of him.” 
Hestuia: “Nope.” *chuckles*
Kris: “…”
Y Ryker: *unconscious*
Cancer:”finally peace and quiet so we can think about what is wrong.”
Ryker: “Wow. Cruel. He’s in pain.”
Cancer:”yeah. I know. I'm not nice.”
Y Ryker: *starts giggling, and gets up* “Ha! Tricked you!”
Cancer:”Well now I really want to punch you.”
Y Ryker: *laughing* “THAT WAS GREAT! HA! You all thought I was in immense pain!”
Dream; * impressed.* “ Good job little Ryker.* 
Cancer:*is holding back very hard to not punch him square in the face*”Have you ever heard of the story called The Boy Who Cried wolf?”
Y Ryker: *continues laughing at Cancer* “No. Sounds stupid.”
Kris: * steals Y Rykers mouth*
Y Ryker: *screams in pain…through his ears*
Kris: * eats Y ryker*
Fails
Kris: * ignores the text above this doing it anyway*
Cancer:”it has a very good moral of the story that applies very well here.”*has zero sympathy*
Dream: “ He's fine.” 
Y Ryker: *takes mouth back* “Thank you very much.”
Dream: “ see.” 
Cancer:” I know he is.”
Y Ryker: “Soo…now what?”
Cancer:”we need to get the Kyle man.”
Dream: “ why? Can i torture him?” 
Y Ryker: *eyes light up* “That would be fun!”
Arson: “ YEAH!!” 
Cancer:”yes, we should go torture him with much fire”*lights on fire*
Arson: “FIRE!!!””
Rae: “ uhhhh how about no.” 
Cancer:”party pooper”
Rae: “ no, I'm just trying to be smart.” 
Cancer:”Well then what are we going to do?”*gestures around them*
Rae: “ I don't know. All I know is that now I have to make sure 3 kids and a woman child doesn't burn down the multiverse.” 
Kris: “you can try to torture me.”
Y Ryker: “Let’s go!” *opens a portal to the lab, ignoring Cancer and Kris*
Dream: “Yeah.”  * runs through.*
Arson: * follows lighting his hands on fire.* “ FIRE!!” 
Kris: *is already there*
Y Ryker and Ryker: *walk through the portal*
Cancer:*follows*
The lab
Jaeger: “We will give you 5 minutes to negotiate and tell us why you had Y Ryker, if you do not have a good reason I will not be able to stop the others from torturing you.”
Y Ryker: “ARRRRRRRRRSSSSSSSSSOOOOOOOOOOOOOOONNNNNNNNNNN!” *begins lighting fires in the Lab*
Arson: “ wahoo!!” * joins.* 
Jaeger: *Puts out fires* “Stop, you are making us look bad.”
Y Ryker: *groans* “But ARSON!”
Jaeger: “If you want to commit Arson go somewhere else.”
Y Ryker: *groans* “NO.” *Arson*
Jaeger: “Fine, you now have 4 minutes.”
Vague lemonade noises from speakers
Jaeger: “Fine then.” *Busts down wall*
It’s another wall
Jaeger: “I will continue until you respond.” *Continues breaking walls*
WAAAAAAAAALLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS
Dream: * joins in on the chaos.* 
Cancer:*summons giant rocket that goes through the walls on the other side*
Walls.
Jaeger: “Guys, they probably aren’t here, meaning we will have to look for them.”
Dream: * runs around burning stuff.* 
Jaeger: “I’ll go see if I can find any evidence of where they could be.”
Arson: “ ok.” * continues burning stuff.* 
Rae: * through the portal.* “ Jaeger! You're responsible for the kids! Don’t let them burn the place down!” 
Jaeger: “Fine.” *puts out fires* “I am going to look for more evidence of where the ‘scientists’ are.”
Dream: * continues lighting fires.* 
Arson: * joins in.* 
Jaeger: “Alright, fine do I need to send you people somewhere else?”
Arson: “ But why can't we burn the place down?!”
Jaeger: “Because one, I am responsible for you, two I need to find the people that had Y Ryker captive.”
Dream: “ but this will help!” 
Jaeger: “No, this won't, it will burn away any evidence there is and will get them hurt before we can interrogate them.”
Dream: “ but Cancer said i could torture him!”
Jaeger: “But Cancer isn’t here right now.”
Dream: “ yeah she is.” * points to Cancer.* 
Kyle: *sitting on a chair in the middle of the room*
Arson: * tries to catch him.* “ get him!” 
He vanishes
Arson: “ ok, NOW can we burn this place down?” 
Cancer:”I think that that is a fantastic idea. Oh, and If we find him again, he shall get the torturing of his life.”
Jaeger: “Maybe, he is probably just teasing us because he knows we are here.”
Cancer:”probably, we should still torture him though.”
Kyle: *from speakers* “Indeed I am, congrats on triggering the security system.” 
Suddenly all of the walls turn extremely solid, and a gas begins to fill the room
Jaeger: “Bruh, you are trying to use a gas on someone who can manipulate air and does not need to breathe.” *Tries to Keep the gas away from everyone*
Cancer:”i can stop breathing”*does so*
Y Ryker: *charges into the smoke* “AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!”
Nothing seems to happen
Cancer:”It’s not the possessing smoke I think”
Jaeger: “It’s probably designed to immobilize us so we can be captured.”
Cancer:”yeah, probably”
Kyle: *from speakers* “Nope!”
Y Ryker: *continues attacking smoke by waving his hands through it*
Cancer:”it's not a solid object, that’s not going to work buddy”
Y Ryker: *glares at Cancer and continues “attacking” smoke*
Jaeger: “Well do you want to give any hints on what it might do?”
Cancer:”that would be nice”
The density of the fog in the room is intensifying, due to Jaeger pushing the smoke away from himself and everyone else (other than Y Ryker)
Cancer:*looks at smoke, sticks arm into smoke, summons bottle and traps some*
Jaeger: “Hey Cancer, could you make an outlet for the smoke to go to?”
Ryker: “Well she could. Or I could. But it doesn’t matter anyway. The way he’s pushing in the gas, it wouldn’t drain fast enough.”
Cancer:”wellll….”*makes outlet underneath them all*
She can’t.
Jaeger: “Well fine then we will wait.” *Stops breathing*
Cancer:”YEAH!!”*stops breathing and plops down*
The smoke fills the room completely
Jaeger: “Dream, Arson, Cancer, would you be okay if I lit the smoke on fire?”
Your Conscience: “Yes”
Y Ryker: *attempts to launch fireball….but fails* “IT DIDN’T WORK!”
Cancer:”yeah, I’d be fine”
Jaeger: “I cannot be the one to light it, I do not have fire manipulation and the energy blasts… just don’t feel right.”
Cancer:”okay.”*makes the smoke hot in a corner to the point of fire
Fails (Powers aren’t working geniuses).
Jaeger: “Great, Ryker, could you do something about this?”
Cancer:*nods*
Ryker: *chilling out* “I could. But that would be a boring story.”
Cancer:”Well what makes a story not boring? hmm?”
Ryker: “A karate nerd.”
Cancer:”well we don’t got one of them”
Jaeger: “Then bring us to Kyle.”
Kyle: *standing in the smoke* “It worked!”
Cancer:”what worked?”*walks over to him and pokes him*
It passes through him
Cancer:”that’s what i figured”
Kyle: *slaps her, and it hurts*
Dream: “ I can do that!”
Cancer:”well that’s not fair”
Kyle: “Why would I make it fair?”
Cancer:”idk”
Catrina: *appears* “So does it work? I doubt your tech sometimes.”
Cancer:”he said it did, did you not hear him?”
Catrina: “No. We’re nowhere near each other.”
Cancer:”okay”*pokes Catrina*
Fails
Catrina: “Essentially, the science behind this is-”
Kyle: *cuts her off* “Gas becomes solid to punch you, then becomes gas again. Gas also breaks neurological functions that access powers.”
Cancer:”okay. So like non-newtonian liquids kinda.”
Kyle: “I was speaking in layman's terms.”
Cancer:”and what are layman’s terms exactly”
Catrina: “Anyways. Since your powers are off…we’ll administer a minor shot just to knock each of you out.”
Cancer:”No.”
Jaeger: “And why should we negotiate with you?”
Catrina: “Because you tried to torture us.”
Cancer:”You weren't even here. We wanted to torture you, but we couln’t”
Jaeger: “Correction they said they would, I wanted to talk first.”
Catrina: “Yeah. We’re not negotiating.”
Cancer:”And that is exactly what we are doing right now”
They all black out. Jaeger wakes up in a new area. (Alone) The speakers click on.
Kyle: “Hey.”
Jaeger: “Good morning, May I please have some tea, my throat is dry.”
Kyle: *pauses* “Sure.” *A small food replicator, like the ones in Star Trek appear*
Jaeger: “What do you want to talk about? You are leading the conversation you brought me here after all.”
Kyle: “Indeed.” *pauses* “I’d like you to sign my T-shirt.” *a t-shirt appears*
Jaeger: *Raises Eyebrow* “Sure…… are you a fan of Rykers ‘show’?”
Kyle: “Yes, and I was originally an engineer at SOUR.”
Jaeger: “Pre-Ryker Escape?”
Kyle: “What exactly are you referring to?”
Jaeger: “During some time travel shenanigans I was there when Ryker escaped and destroyed SOUR.”
Kyle: “Oh. You’re referring to the Crazy Ryker-Ryker separation.”
Jaeger: “Ah, what exactly did you do at SOUR? I thought Ryker just made tons of clones of himself to run the place.”
Kyle: “Not exactly. He hired ‘Rykers’ from across the multiverse and invited them to a perfect society.”
Jaeger: “Ah, ‘Perfect’ Society, do you know my backstory? It was a supposed ‘Perfect Society’. Anyways back on topic I recommend keeping the others contained they can be much less.. Civilized than me.”
Kyle: “I recognize that, which is why I woke you up first. The others are contained.”
Jaeger: “Good, don’t want to be mean to them but they already wanted to kill you. So other than the signature, any other questions?” *Starts Signing shirt* 
Kyle: “Actually yes. Do you know exactly how you left your ‘Matrix’, and how long you were in there?”
Jaeger: “What do you mean ‘Matrix’?”
Kyle: “That little simulation…” *grudgingly* “‘Ryker’ made.”
Jaeger: “Ryker didn’t seem very open about the details of the simulation so I do not know much.”
Kyle: *Mutters* “Well that’s cause he didn’t know.”
Jaeger: “The simulation started off stable but started to… deteriorate, little bugs and glitches.”
Kyle: “That’s because he put too much pressure on it. WAY too many characters loaded at the same time in SOUR.”
Jaeger: “That sounds like something Ryker would do, have months of planning and have it fail from a small oversight.”
Kyle: *Chuckles* “Months? Try years, decades even. That’s the strongest simulation ever built.”
Jaeger: “Let me try a shot in the dark, did you help build it?”
Kyle: “I was the head of operations. Until….Ryker destroyed SOUR, and locked the simulation. I unlocked it, made it slightly unstable, and broke you all out. You’re welcome.”
Jaeger: “Well, thank you, out of curiosity, who was your favorite, if not me?”
Kyle: “Obviously Ryker. That was VERY hard to program. Think about all of the little personalities I had to put in his head. That alone took up half the RAM.”
Jaeger: “He seemed a little underpowered. It was probably as powerful you could make him while adding in the other Characters
Kyle: *nods*
Jaeger: “So what are you looking for revenge? Cookies? Strawberry milk?”
Kyle: “Ryker destroyed my perfect simulation. I want to destroy his perfect little multiverse.”
Jaeger: “Ah, revenge. How do you plan to do this due to the… complications.”
Kyle: “Get you all on my side.”
Jaeger: “Well, after you achieve your goal what do you plan on doing?”
Kyle: “Fixing my simulation.”
Jaeger: “Then what will you do with it?”
Kyle: “Observe.”
Jaeger: “I see. Now, what do you want me to do?”
Kyle: “Get the others to not kill me. Including Ryker.”
Jaeger: “Dream and Arson love fire if that helps. Cancer… just wants Y Ryker to be safe. Y Ryker is a unique case.”
Kyle: “That’s why I wanted to train him to be on my side. You all screwed that up.”
Jaeger: “True. I assume my powers are dampened. Y Ryker might join your side if you can find out what he wants.”
Kyle: *sighs* “Yet again. If none of you would have interfered, then this all would have been fine.”
Jaeger: “Is there any way to Pay you back?”
Kyle: “Just leave me be. I’ll do what I have to.”
Jaeger: “So is Catrina watching over the others? Also, how do you plan on getting us out of here? I plan on leaving you alone. I do not know about the others.”
Kyle: “Catrina is my muscle. All of your friends are safe and sound in the void. They’ll wake up in…” *checks watch* “an hour or so. And then I’ll move my lab.”
Jaeger: “Well, Enjoy the signature, do you have anything I should tell them?”
Kyle: “Just don’t try to ‘torture’ me again.”
Jaeger: “I will tell them to chill and that you just wanted a Signature.”
Kyle: “Thanks. The power smoke should wear off in…7 seconds.” *the lab vanishes, along with Kyle.*
One hour later…..
Jaeger: “Good morning people, would you like some tea?”
Cancer:”Not your teee.”*summons sea water in a cup, slurps*
Jaeger: “Fine, anyways they just wanted a signature and it was the safest way to avoid getting killed.”
Cancer:”Okay. Well i still want to torture them. Especially because they knocked me out. I really don’t like that. They have made an enemy today.”
Y Ryker: “TORTURE!”
Dream: *Mumbles.* “ I hurt everywhere.” 
Jaeger: “Trust me this time if you do not leave them alone you will be met with much backlash, the only thing they wanted was to be left alone.”
Cancer:”Well then why did they want us blacked out. They could have just told us that.”
Jaeger: “Well… you were heaven bent on trying to torture them, I was the most calm.”
Dream: “ I’ll leave them be.” 
Cancer:”Well… fine. But I am still mad at them and will likely not cooperate”
Jaeger: “I do not have contact with them but assume they are keeping an eye on us.”
Y Ryker: “BURNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNN! BE CONTRARY TO CANCER!”
Jaeger: “Thank you, also young Ryker, do I have to go get Rae?”
Y Ryker: *Fearful* “No.”
Jaeger: “Good, let's go someplace where you can burn things to your heart's content.”
Your Conscience: “Like me”
Cancer:”Fire is nice”
Y Ryker: “We could also just BURRRRRRNNNNNNNNNN THE LAB!”
Dream: “ I like Fire. I just don't like the chest ache.” 
Jaeger: “Lets go to where Nightfall would be.”
Your Conscience: “You love arson” The Editor: “No, I don’t”
Cancer:”Okay.”*vanishes*
Ryker: “Or I could resummon Nightfall.”
Arson: “ Can I light fires there?”
Jaeger: “Yes, there is plenty of room.”
Arson; ‘ ok.’
Conscience: “Can I come?”
Ryker: *re-exists Nightfall*
Cancer:*comes back*”really. You had to remake it. It’s not authentic, you know.”
Conscience: “Doesn’t that take a lot of work?”
Jaeger: “First make a real character, second this is Ryker.”
Cancer:”It’s still not authentic.”
Payne: “This is weird”
Cancer:”What's weird?”
Payne: “ I have no idea how I got here”
Cancer:”neither do any of us”
Dream: *Whimpers in pain.* 
Jaeger: “Payne this is your first time visiting nightfall, please read the rules.” *Gives 500 page rulebook*
Cancer:”You don’t want to. It’s very boring, I’ve already done it.”
Payne: “Nightfall is a place or a plain?”
Cancer:”Yes, Dream, are you OK?”
Dream: *Shakes head.* 
Cancer:”Well what’s wrong because everybody's had something wrong and it takes forever to figure it out.”
Dream: “ I hurt… everywhere.” 
Cancer:”Well that’s not very descriptive. I wonder if the smoke broke you somehow.”
Dream: “ I dont know.” 
Payne: “I read it but it's only talking about leaving it” *Thinks* “ Could you brief me on it?”
Cancer:”Don’t sneeze in the no sneezing room”
Payne: ” What happens if I do, will I die?”
Dream: “ It's .. going .. away.” 
Cancer:”That's good. You will be kicked out, I think, or you may die. If you break the other rules you will be kicked out.”
Payne: “I will follow behind”
5 Beings appear in the sky and form a circle around nightfall
Void: “Ryker you have committed a crime against the timeline.”
Payne: *Points* “Look the elders”
Jaeger: “Ryker, you have angered the elders, we are screwed!” *Leaves*
Dream: * Leaves with Jaeger.* 
Arson: * Follows.*
Hestuia: *Slurping smoothie* “Whoops. Was I supposed to stop this?”
Void: “Surrender and leave or face…”
Payne: *Whispers* “This looks bad”
Y Ryker: *Uses teleportation to get everyone (other than Ryker, Payne, and Hestuia)  out*
The ground begins to tremble.
Payne: *Falls over*
Cancer:*Teleports to Jaeger*
Elders: “Beings of the time, your crime will not go unpunished” *They lift out there hands and a beam of pure darkness comes out* “Crimes committed will go punished undo all that has been done”
Everything begins to crumble into nothingness
Elders: “We complete our spell with the final curse, Mystic arts of time undo all that they have done. Blackness will consume you”
Ryker: *Creates another Nightfall*
Ryker feels a presence behind him and it fails and he forgets how to create the start.
Achievement: Fastest character death HOW! I thought no one could beat Joey. Like, how?
Meanwhile At SOUR
Dream: “ Jaeger, why'd you leave us?” 
* John Joins* “Why hello there” 
Arson: “ Hi.” 
Jaeger: “You guys do not realize how dangerous the Elders are.”
Dream: “ then you should have taken us with you.”
Cancer:”Why were they trying to kill all of us, or were we just in the crossfire. I don’t think that we have angered them in any way.”
Jaeger: “We were in the crossfire and I do not have the power to take people with me, but yes I should have warned you.”
John: “I believe we should be safe for now, right?”
Cancer:”Yes, I hope”
Meanwhile….in SOUR
Ryker: *Teleports Void to him.* “We need to talk.”
Void: “Ah, Ryker, I was hoping to chat.”
Ryker: “Are you trying to mess with my Multiverse? I don’t like it when people do that.”
Void: “No, If anything I am trying to make it better, if you will renovate it, I want to bring in an area like no other! It will be incredible.”
Ryker: “That sounds like evil madman nonsense. Continue.”
Void: “Can I show you what I mean?”
Ryker: “Sure.”
The room changes to a large open landscape, there are people in a peaceful village, the plants are beautiful and the technology and history are working hand in hand. The people are clearly not human. The man: “Where is the world viewer”
The girl: “Right here”
The world is perfect even with its imperfections. There is no evil, it is happy, Then he sees another world full of chaos, then a world of perfectly neutral *Cough* *Cough* “Switzerland” *Cough* It is all a world of dreams, and nightmares.
Ryker: “Yeah. But everything being the same is boring. Chaos and order go together, like throwing dust into someone’s eyes. You need both to have a good time. Without them…it’s just dull. If that’s what you’re trying to do, I’m going to have to stop you.”
Void: “Ohh trust me, this is only the start” *Touches Ryker’s forehead*
Ryker begins to not only see but feel the power there he can bend anything to his reality not only in the way that he already can but in a more fulfilling way then as he shapes reality to his liking he feels an overwhelming sensation like nothing he has felt before. Then he begins to hear a song that feels so surely that he feels drawn to it. Then he begins to have thousands of perspectives go through him seeing everything that ever happened in the old world then the vision freezes and he sees a group of 10 elders in a circle chanting.
Void: *Seems annoyed that this memory is playing* “You should not have seen that. They are the reason…”
Ryker: “Leave. Or die. Your choice.”
Void: *Projects one last thought then leaves*
The thought is a photo of the mage’s again but this time they are seemingly pouring the power into a strange mass of an object that has a strange shein.
Hestuia: *Chilling* “Huh.”
Ryker: “BACK TO DA FUTTTTTTTTTUUUUUUUURE!” *Back to the future music kicks in, and he goes to an undisclosed point in the “past”.*
In new [REDACTED]
Void: *Coughs* “He drained me more than I thought”
Alarm Goes off
Void: “WHO BROKE TIME AGAIN!”
Hestuia: *Hanging out* “A monkey and a pickle.”
Void: *Begins saying somewhat questionable words in his native tongue* “RYKER! I SWEAR IF YOU KEEP DOING THIS”
The “Past”
Ryker: *Walks over to a monkey* “Pickle.” *he then returns to the present*
Monkey: * Begins completing the universe.* 
The Present
Ryker: *Eating a pickle-monkey-sicle* “Yum.”
Void: *Appears* “RYKER! STOP! YOU” *Clearly Enraged*
Ryker: *Returns to da Past*
Da Past
Ryker: *hands monkey pickle and returns to Da present*
Monkey: * contemplates the multiverse.* 
Da Present
Ryker: “It wasn’t pickle-y enough.”
Void: “YOU HAVE LOST YOUR PLACE!” *Walks over to a small switch on the wall and flicks it on and off 20 times* “I hate fixing timeline stuff.”
Ryker: “Then don’t.”
Void: *Says more questionable stuff in language.* “I am done with this.”
Ryker: *pulls out hand* “Monkey or death?”
John: “The Monkey”
Void: “No, bye” *disappears*
Ryker: “That’s what I thought.”
Present Author: “The story is going stale, I think I need to do something about that” *Waves hand and a being is brought back into reality*
Achievement: “Welcome back 4th wall.”
John: *Thinks* “Where do the achievements come from, who decides?”
THE Author: “No.”
4th Wall: *ceases to exist* The Editor: “For now.”
Achievement: “Quickest Existence and loss of a recurring character”
John: "Nooooo!!! Guy I haven't met noooo!"
Meanwhile
Dream: “ ok i'm officially bored.” * starts lighting stuff on fire.*
Arson: “ yay Fire!” * joins in.* 
Y Ryker: “FIRE!” *joins in*
Cancer:”fire”*lights on fire*
Dream: “ Someone take care of Jaeger so he doesn't stop us!” 
Cancer:*raises walls around Jaeger in a very large box, covers the top, duplicates the mist she trapped and puts some in the box*
Ya can’t. It is literally the anti-power (it can’t be duplicated)
Jaeger: *Breaks box and puts out the fires and prevents any more from being lit*
Arson: * lights liquid oxygen on fire.* 
Jaeger: *takes it away and throws it off a cliff*
Arson: * just gets more.* 
Y Ryker: *fills room with liquid oxygen*
Back with void
Void: “HE SAW IT!”
Aios: “VOID! WHY DID YOU SHOW HIM THAT! THE FALL IS HIDDEN FOR A REASON!”
Void: “I..I” *Looks genuinely scared of Aios*
Aios: “Void, How much did he see?”
Void: “He did not hear the whole spell.”
Aios: “He saw enough, the illusion we built, it could be recreated.”
Void: “None of us are powerful enough to build a new one.”
Aios: “Bring me the book of time” *Flips through book until he hits a page* “No one in this time line or any other is strong enough to handle the spell. Not even ryker… For now. In the past if he found them, or if they were freed he could destroy ours and build a new one.”
Void: “No one will be as powerful as the 10 mage.”
Ryker: *somehow there* “10 MAGE! NOW! COME! HERE! YES!”
Ryker is simply hit with a sharp piece of glass
Aios: “YOU FOOL! THESE PEOPLE WOULD MAKE THE STRONGEST OF US BOW DOWN!”
Void: “Sssory Mmmaster should I deal with him?”
Aios: *Looks enraged* “Ryker leave us” *touches hand to ground and they vanish.* “I must go the council is waking off”
Void: *Touches hand to ground and the council looks less enraged*
Aios: “Good idea Void I think that is a good note to end on”
Ryker: *analyzes piece of glass, looking at its genetic makeup, who (or what) has touched it, it’s past history, etc*
Ryker sees that it is very old and has clearly been written on. It says: “The last person who tried this ended up in a usb drive for almost 8000 years. -The 10 Mage”
Ryker: *scoffs* “All right, buster. I just wanna talk. Can you do that for me? We both don’t want whatever Void’s doing to happen.”
Ryker feels a small prick in his thumb and another piece of glass is in it it reads: “How can you talk to something that is all, how do you talk to someone that never dreams? How do you speak to reality?”
Ryker: “How can you be such a mysterious person. It’s just a phase.” *rolls eyes* “You’ll grow out of it.”
The mirror in front of him shatters and the glass forms the words: “We will not speak with you, we are all and one of it all. The past holds all.”
Ryker: “Why? Cause you’re CHICKEN!”
One more piece of glass hits him and this time it actually manages to hurt him: “Do not trifle with your reality. We are not who we seem, but we can hurt all, we are not speaking to you from this time.”
Ryker: “I’m not afraid of WEAKER BEINGS!”
Void: *Rolls his eyes* “They can’t come to you, he left so many messages in this place all set to trigger based off of the timeline.”
Ryker: “SO? I’ll find him in the past!”
Void: *Begins laughing so hard he begins to cry.* “You! really!”
Hestuia: *walked through the area Ryker took to get here* “He really isn’t as smart as he thinks.”
Void: “He, who are you talking about. 5 of them are not in time at all and the other 5, well, you do not want to talk to them.”
Hestuia: “I was referring to Ryker.”
Void: “Oh, no, I am talking to ryker, his thoughts are very loud right now.”
Ryker: *Glares at them* “I could annihilate ALL OF YOU RIGHT NOW!”
Void: “I mean you could, I’ll be back the moment you kill any of us. If you wipe the timeline, you will lose the spell, if you kill us we will simply return.”
Ryker: “BAH! I DON’T CARE ABOUT YOUR SILLY ‘REVIVAL’ spells! I can do ANYTHING I want to.” *he snaps, and kills the elders*
THE Author: “And I mean completely annihilate. Like with NO chance of returning. You DON’T trifle with Ryker.”
Present Author: “Good, I have been waiting for this!”
A darkness comes over everyone. 5 bolts of lightning hit the chairs. 5 beings in black cloaks appear and a small gem in front of each of them they put it together and then sit.
Zlo: “Ryker, Thank you!”
Ryker: *enraged* “WHOS NEXT! YOU?” *looks at the beings*
Zlo: “Did you really think that the council would end! No.”
Ryker: “DON’T TALK TO ME LIKE A CHILD!” *he simply annihilates them as well.*
A darkness comes over everyone. 5 bolts of lightning hit the chairs. 5 beings in black cloaks appear and a small gem in front of each of them they put it together and then sit.
Zlo: “This is the paradox we are apart, we will just reappear, do not worry though, I have no plans to mess with you.”
Ryker: *sighs* “Then just leave the world as it is. I’m sick of Multiverse-ending disasters.”
Zlo: “We will not interfere with you. Unlike our past selves we have a sense of preservation.” *They all disappear.*
Hestuia: *chilling, then seems to pay attention* “Huh. No. You need to interfere.”
Marckx: “What did you do?”
Ryker: “You don’t mess with me.”
Marckx: “Please tell me you did not kill 2 sets of council members.”
Ryker: *shrugs* “Of course I did.”
Markx: “You finished the prophecy, Hestuia this is timeline 45abz32419 variant b4 if you would like to keep up. This next group is known as the age of darkness, they scare me. I’m not too worried though, they mostly just plot and scheme this timeline, not much comes of it. The first Zlo is much more dangerous than this one. So I mean you should be safe from multiversal madness for a while, unless he somehow messes this next part up. Timeline 4432wex3312 adjustment 3s will happen and I would love to avoid that if we could, I think you can agree Hestuia right?”
Hestuia: “What about adjustment 4?”
Marckx: “I mean if you want, but that also eventually leads to your death soooo, I am assuming not. I have only studied some of that time line so I am not sure, I do not have as good of control of it as you.”
Hestuia: “NO adjustment 4A!”
Markx: “I mean, ryker does get to become an old grandpa in that one so it could be funny. Though I can not see too far into that one, I am assuming you hid that from us. I think we should just stay on the 5th variant class 3dx4” *pauses* “I will let you decide in most. I can complete my goal so I do not care.”
Hestuia: *sighs* “You’re using the classification system all wrong.”
Markx: “Or we could let the dice decide” *Hold out a strange looking dice with what looks like never ending sides.* “Do you recognize this?”
Hestuia: “Yes.”
Markx: “I have always wanted to do it.”
Hestuia: “Don’t. In alpha sector, class orange, organization 567xB, quadrant 17, we all die.”
Markx: “That is a risk I am willing to take.”
Hestuia: “Well I’m not. Everything must be assured. And I’m done discussing this with you.”
Markx: “Okay” *pauses* “I’m sorry I just needed to suggest it.”
Hestuia: *quiet* “Plus, I’m fine…” *he glances at Ryker* “Go follow them.”
Ryker: *does so* “BUT NOT CAUSE YOU’RE TELLING ME TO!”
Markx: *Chuckles* “Yep.”
Ryker: “Hey, so what is your plan Zlo?”
John: "What is the plan?"
Zlo: *Touches floor and the whole room begins to morph* “Time shall start from this point onward. The source is all!” *The entire area begins to be destroyed and rebuilt aka your cue to run if you are not an elder or ryker or overpowered.*
Ryker: *bored* “Okay.”
Hestuia: *hides behind Ryker*
Markx: “Why is it that everytime someone dies they have to rebuild this place? I mean come on.”
Ryker: *clears throat* “Well I could do it if I wanted to.”
Marckx: “It is kind of like a tradition for them. Also, these members don’t hate me… as much, so they will not arrest me.”
Hestuia feels like someone punched him in the gut then he collapses and when he gets up his tie to the elders feels weakend.
Void: *appears behind him except they are not in the same outfit he is now in a pure black suit* “Your connection will not be as strong, I failed and was killed and sense you are linked to me you are not as strong.”
Ryker: “NO!” *Blasts Void*
Void: *Oww* “I am not the same person, I am from a different timeline. I am the only one that was not destroyed because I am the only variant who is a light elder. I mean I would prefer for you to not completely kill me off but if you must-”
Ryker: *kills him off*
Markx: “Umm, you know…”
Hestuia feels like someone is stabbing him over and over again until his contract is ripped from the remote and destroyed
Marckx: “Sorry, ”
Hestuia: *unaffected* “I’m fine.”
Marckx: *Looks at him* “You lost your elder position. Just be glad I altered it so it would not kill you.” *Winces as he feels the power leave him.* “Dang, seeing the future was fun.”
Hestuia: *chuckles* “Imagine.”
Present author: “I feel like a new big thing needs to happen, it is way too peaceful. I will let you break things.”
THE Author: “I’ve got you fam.”
Present Author: “Thanks, I have kind of hit the end of all of my planning.”
Ryker: “I want to feel included.”
Present Author: “You do not get a say in this” *Drop kicks ryker* “There I feel better now.”
Ryker: “Rude. Now, time to screw up everyone's plans.” *kills Hestuia*
Present Author: “YAY!”
Hestuia: “Nice try.” *doesn’t die* “I have plot armor.”
Ryker: “Wait. That’s illegal.” *duplicates source, and begins chuckling like Bill Cipher* 
Present Author: *Rolls eyes* “Really. I mean why, he already kind of had it”
Ryker: *continues laughing like a madman, screwing up timelines*
A while later
Ryker: *calms down* “I’m….fine.” *he sighs* “Just disappointed. This new season isn’t living up to my expectations.” *he teleports the entire general group to SOUR* “I’m sorry. But I’m going to have to let you all go. You’ve had a nice life.” *he holds out his hand* “See ya!” *waits for a few moments for reactions*
Jaeger: “Well, the story has only really had 2 main plot points, Hestuia elder stuff, and Kyle.” *Tries to escape when Ryker’s attention is on someone else knowing that Ryker will probably notice.*
Ryker: *notices, but does nothing* “You all have 10 minutes to flee. Then I’m sending Wiziker after you. I’d recommend running.”
Jaeger: “Well, goodbye then.” *Goes to [Redacted] and starts pondering on how to contact Kyle*
Dream: * follows.* 
Arson: * does the same.* 
Cancer:*follows*
Wiziker: *perks up* “Me! PLEASE NO! I JUST SAW ALL MY FRIENDS DIE BEFORE!”
Ryker: “You will do it or die.” *Ryker begins chuckling, insane.*
Marckx: “Ryker you don’t have to do this. Please.”
Ryker: “9 minutes.”
Hestuia, Lyra, and Y Ryker: *vanish*
Rae: * vanishes as well and takes William with her.* 
An alarm begins to sound
Zlo: “The timeline!”
A monitor is showing the time line going crazy
Zlo: “THEY ARE COMING!”
Aios: “Can we stop it”
Zlo: “No”
Aios: “Core 5 is overheating!”
Zlo: “I have lost control over sector 5!”
Meanwhile 
Dream: “ Jaeger!  man you really suck at taking us with you.” 
Jaeger: “Who said I would take you with me, my shift of babysitting is over.”
Dream: “ says who?”
John: “She's got a point”
Jaeger: “Says me, and we shouldn’t stay in a group because we will be easier to find.”
Dream: “ ahh so we're playing a killer game of hide and seek.” 
Cancer:*nods*
5 Minutes…..
In new [REDACTED]
Zlo: “He’s on a rampage!”
Aios: “Is it time?”
Zlo: “Yes”
An alarm begins to sound then a voice comes over the intercom: “This is a level 10 emergency, all must evacuate to Point Z for more information.”
Aios: “I have lost communication to the time reactor.”
Zlo: “The system is collapsing, we need to get out!”
Aios: “What about the source?”
Zlo: “If he somehow managed to break it, well he will have to deal with them.”
The room shutters
Zlo: “Evacuate NOW!”
The Elders begin to flee.
Aios: “I hate to say this, but we need marckx.”
Zlo: “You might be right”
Aios: “He was the only one that managed to break our illusion. He knows how to awaken them.”
Back with Jaeger, Dream, Arson, Cancer, John, ect.
Marckx: “We need to get out of here.”
Cancer:”I may be able to do something.”
Marckx: “I am going…” *Lifts up into the air* “They are summoning me. Evacuate to the dr….” *Is cut off and then disappears.*
2 minutes…..
Cancer:*vanishes into the nothingness in between multiverses, releases the inbetween*
Jaeger: “The rest of you go to your own secret places, this is mine, because currently if Wiziker finds us he will find many of us.”
Dream: “ ok.” * teleports away.*
Arson: * follows.* 
Y Ryker: “Ryker won’t kill me.”
Hestuia: “Yeah he will.”
Jake: *Begins to laugh* “It’s too late, ryker knows all” *Coughs* “He can be stopped. I only have about one more minute before I am summoned to protect.”
Ryker: “You’re right. But I’m not chasing you. Wiziker is.” *pauses* “1 Minute.” *vanishes*
Jaeger: “Also, I said I went to [Redacted] so none of you should have been able to follow me except maybe Y Ryker and Cancer.”
Y Ryker: “Sorry. That’s my fault.”
Jaeger: “It’s alright but, if it comes down to a fight between me and Wiziker, I want you guys to flee.”
Chimes begin to sound across the Multiverse…
Y Ryker: “He’s coming.”
All of THE Authors characters: *vanish to different areas*
Rae: * vanishes and takes William with her.*
In the Inbetween
Cancer:*shapes it into a doughnut shape so that it supports itself*
The In between changes shape and sudderes quite violently, the doughnut edges move in a rotation-like motion
Cancer:*releases the mist that she had been tinkering with*
It spreads all throughout the inbetween, being slightly opaque
Cancer:*changes to original shape and travels to the very center of the doughnut, where everything pulls in a circular pattern around the doughnut shape, creates a floating area*
A city seems to rise out of the floating land, a large tower comes out of the center, a giant crystal floating inbetween some tongs in the shape of a ram’s skull
Cancer:*goes to the outer center area of the doughnut, where the actual doughnut meat would be*
Towers start rising at regular intervals all around the doughnut meat, with various skulls in between some tongs on top. A beam of energy shoots from the center tower, lighting up all of the towers, a forcefield like phenomenon forms between all of the towers, creating a dome.
Cancer:*returns to center city, releases gem animals*
The gem creatures turn into gem people
Gem People:*bow down to cancer*
Cancer:*sits down in front of the center tower*
The buildings, people, the towers all look geometric and angular, as though they are made out of crystal
Cancer:”Welcome to the Inbetween”*seals off the Inbetween*
Newcago: Steel
Jaeger: “I need to find somewhere to hide, hmm I will use the alias steelheart and rule the city to disguise myself.” *He turns the entire city of chicago into steel, Surprise, he was on earth! He then takes over the city and rules as its emperor, making life there generally better.* 
The Lab
Kyle: *flinches at the arrival of Y Ryker* “What are you doing here!”
Y Ryker: “Hiding.”
Kyle: “From what?”
Y Ryker: “Wiziker.”
Kyle: *sighs* “Okay.” *shoves him into a large group of Y Rykers in a room*
Libraraararary
Lyra: *chilling in the Libaraarararary with the Librarararaian*
Jake: “Umm, Lyra, can I talk to you?”
Lyra: *looks at Jake* “Sure.”
Jake: “Wiziker is on a rampage, ryker told him to do it, he is hunting you and everyone else down. You should probably hide.”
Lyra: “I AM hiding.”
Jake: “Okay, just needed to make sure.” *leaves*
Meanwhile, Dream and Arson are in a dark area. Arson clings to Dream clearly afraid. 
Arson: *whimpers*“ D-Dream? Are you scared?” 
Dream: * laughs.* “ No, not really.” 
Arson: “ oh.” * pause.* “Is it bad that I'm scared?”
Dream: * shifts.* 
Evelin: “ no love. It's ok to be scared.” 
Arson: “ really?”
Evelin: * nods.* “ Everyone gets scared at some time.” 
Arson: * clings closer to Dream.* 
Evelin: “ don’t worry , love. I will keep you safe.” * pull him closer to her.* 
Arson: “ promise?”
Evelin: “ I promise. We're on our own now. We’ve got to look after each other.” 
Ryker: “Are you?”
Evelin: “ what are you doing here?” 
Ryker: “Filming.”
Evelin: * rolls her eyes.* “ why. I thought we weren’t interesting enough for you?” 
Ryker: “I made it more interesting…manually.”
Evelin: * rolls eyes.* 
The library
Wiziker: *appears* “All right. Here we go.” *he walks into the library, the librarian isn’t there.* “Come out Lyra. I know you’re heeeeere!”
Lyra: *just reading a book* “Yeah? Oh hi Wiziker. You’re here to kill me right?”
Wiziker: *pauses* “….yes? Why aren’t 
you fighting…or fleeing…or something.”
Lyra: “Because I’m not afraid of you.”
Wiziker: *holds out his hand and shocks her, making her drop to the floor*
Lyra: *cries for help*
Wiziker: “I’m…sorry.” *he snaps Lyras neck, killing her, and vanishes*
Back to Dream, Arson, Ryker and Evelin
Cameraman Ryker: “Well that was a boring first kill. This better get interesting.”
Arson: * eyes widen, he hugs Evelin closer.* 
Evelin: “ It's ok Arson.” * holds Arson tightly.* 
Cameraman Ryker: “Hey, where’s Rae?”
Evelin: “ I dunno.” 
Ryker: “Dang. I wanted some good footage.” *he vanishes*
Newcago
Wiziker: *fades into existence* “Ah. Jaeger. Your powers truly are fascinating.” *he strolls around the town, unconcerned, toward Jaeger*
Jaeger: “Guards, deal with him.”
The Guards point energy rifles at him with no visible source of power and fire which, of course, does nothing.
Wiziker: *snaps and they turn to dust* “All right Jaeger, meet your demise.”
Jake: *Appears behind Wiziker* “Wiziker, step down, the heir is under my protection.” *His eyes have lost their classic happy look.* “May Earth Reign Supreme!”
A dark blue aura forms around him.
Wiziker: *head turns 180 degrees* “Why hello Jake! This’ll be INTERESTING.” *he begins to chuckle* “Here we go!” *He blasts energy beams at both of them simultaneously.*
Jake: *Disappears and reappears in front of him and absorbs the energy* “You fool, I am the keeper of energy.”
Wiziker: *raises eyebrows* “I know.”
Jake: “Ryker, you are an awful person for making him do this.”
Jaeger: *Dodges the blast* “You really think that a small blast such as that is enough?”
Wiziker: “I really don’t.” *he begins melting the entire city*
Jake: *Waves hand and a small device apars that begins to send a freezing wave around the city* “No” *Sends message to outer being: “NOW”*
Wiziker: “I really am sorry.”
5 copies of him appear.
All: “We are sorry for you wiziker. But, we have no choice, leave now or we must.”
Wiziker: *sighs* “I’ll leave.” *vades away*
Jake: *appears form on top of a building* “That was more difficult than I thought. He will not be gone for long.” *Taps foot twice and the clones vanish.* “Oh yah, I am also not the actual Jake, He just sent a replica to decide how powerful of a hold ryker has over him, I can not be compromised.” *Presses self-destruct button on sleeve and pops out of existence.*
In ???
Jake: “From what I can tell, he has much more control than I thought, but not over his mind.”
Aios: “Marckx, can they?”
Marckx: “Yes, it would need to happen unintentionally but, I think it can happen.”
Aios: “Then we must prepare”*Projects voice* “Elders, it is TIME!”
In Newcogo
New Achievement for Jaeger: “Good job you were able to fight him off!”
New Achievement for Jake: “Now there are 5 or 6 I don’t know, stop cloning yourself!”
New Achievement for Wiziker: “Fight the Power!”
In random void
GLaDOS: “Hello, did you forget about me, Hello!”
In Space
Space Core: “SPAaaAAaaAAaaAce!”
Wheatley: “Yes! I know we are in space! That’s all you can talk about!”
Rick: “I just don’t get why I wasn’t in the final cutscene! I was so heroic! Sacrificing myself for the lady.”
Wheatley: “I would be fine, being literally anywhere else!”
Back in ???
Zlo: “Are we strong enough to handle an illusion like this?”
Marckx: “illusion, No, this is much more real, this is a 메모리 재발” *Pauses* “This is much, much more powerful, I need to disconnect completely from the source to, well, start over.”
Aios: “It will be” *Touches the ground and points at marckx* “You are free”
In Newcogo
Jaeger's phone begins to ring.
Phone: *Plays Ringtone* “Duh Duh Duh Duh Duh Duh Duh Duh Duh Duh Duh Duhhhhhhhhhhh Duh Duh Duh Duh Duh Duh Duh Duh Duh Duh Duh Duh Duh Duh Duh Duh Duh DuhDuh Duh Duh Dummmmmmmm” *Gets Louder* *Gets so loud that the building begin to shake*
Jaeger: *Answers phone* “Yes?” *Flies around the city* “Can I help you?” 
Jake: “Hey, wiziker is not done attempting to kill you. I have my sight on him, I need you next time you see him to try and get him to follow you out of the city, try to get him to a lake. If you can get him there then we can strike.”
Jaeger: “I will call him out and act like it is a battle between Epics so the people understand. I am in Chicago, any lake in particular?”
Jake: “As long as it is pure water.”
Jaeger: “ How does lake Michigan sound?”
Jake: “That will do.”
He gets another call.
Jaeger: *Pulls out second phone* “Yes?”
Kyle: “Why is Y Ryker here?”
Jaeger: “Ryker is doing a Dream manhunt to get more views on his show and we all decided to hide from him.”
Kyle: “Well I don’t want him.”
Jaeger: “Well what do you want to do?”
Kyle: “Go get him.”
Jaeger: “From where?” *arrives back at the tower*
Y Ryker: *arrives randomly* “How…am I here?”
Jaeger: “Kyle called me and he does not want you there so………. Welcome to Newcago my ‘Empire’.”
Y Ryker: “Well I’m gonna go…”
Jaeger: “Where?”
Y Ryker: “Kyle.”
Jaeger: “Kyle, he is trying to come back.”
Kyle: *sighs* “Tell him no.”
Jaeger: “I don’t think that will work.”
Y Ryker: “What he saying.”
Jaeger: “To tell you no to coming back.”
Y Ryker: “‘Dang. I guess I can’t go then.”
Jaeger: “He actually listened.”
Y Ryker: *sighs*
Jaeger:*Hangs up* “Anyways, where do you want to go instead?”
Y Ryker: “I wanna find Dream!”
Meanwhile
Arson: “ Hey Eve?”
Evelin: “ yes?”
Arson: “ how long do we have to stay here?”
Evelin: “ I don't know.” 
Arson: “ Where's little Ryker?” 
Evelin: “ I don't know.” * laughs.* “ I'm only two years older than you. I don’t have all the answers.” 
Ryker: “Oh. Little Ryker’s fiiiiiiiinnnnnnnee.”
Evelin: “uhh ok.’’
Arson: * seems relieved. Mumbles something to Evelin.*
Evelin: * laughs.* “ Well that's fair. I'm not fond of him either but it's just something we have to live with.” 
Arson: * thinks.* “ What do we do if Wiziker finds us?” 
Evelin: “ We'll take care of that.”
Wiziker: *fades….into existence?*
Dream: “ time to go.” * grabs Arson and teleports to a new location.*
Wiziker: *lets them go*
In the center of lake michigan
Aios: “SHould we really do this?”
Marckx: “Too late to go back now”
Zlo: “I don’t like this, if it fails, we’re all dead.”
Marckx: “It’s the only way”
They all put their hand in the water and it flickers between water and a strange pale pink mist. Then is becomes super clear, but the bottom is almost reflective
Marckx: “It is opened, it should last long enough for him to enter.” *Looks confused* “I have lost communication with lyra. Can you sense her?”
Jake: “No, let me check if I can find her location.” *Disappears and immediately appears.* “I have lost all communication also.” *pauses* “That means either she went completely radio dark, or she is dead.”
Marckx: “Let's hope it is the latter.”
Wiziker: *appears* “DEATH!”
Marckx: “RYKER, HOW!” *pauses* “Ohh, I see”
Wiziker: “I can speak numerous languages. Also, your precious Lyra is dead.”
Zlo: “No, what did you do!”
Marckx: *Begins shaking*
Aios: “NOW!”
A large gust of wind blows hard enough to make the trees blow Marckx begins to float into the air and lightning begins to appear in the air
Zlo: “Marckx, you can resist it.”
Marckx come down but now he is in a dark cloak
Marckx: “The final spell has been broken, I am no longer bound to you.” *Looks at wiziker in a strange rage that was not there before* “You have made a grave mistake.” *He picks up a small stick and it begins to shrivel into a pure black staff.*
Meanwhile in Newcago
Y Ryker: “UNO!!”
Jaeger: “Behold the legendary draw 64!”
Y Ryker: “THAT’S CHEATING!”
Jaeger: “It was one of the make your own design cards and I wrote it so it says only Jaeger can use and if someone is not Jaeger and they use this card they draw 64 and I win.”
Phone: “Duh Duh Duh Duh Duh DuhDuhDuh DuhDuhDuh Duh duh duh duh duh duhhhhhhhhhhhhh duh”
Jaeger: *Answers phone and changes ringtone to Roar of the Jungle dragon* “Yes?”
Jake: “GET OUT! RYKER WAS STUPID AND DID NOT PROTECT LYRA, MARCKX IS NOW COMPLETELY FREED, AND HE IS MAD!” *Pants* “I MEAN IT MIGHT WORK FOR OUR PLANE, BUT HE IS SUPER MAD AND UNLEASHED, WELL, THERE IS A REASON” *Pants* “HE WAS LOCKED UP GET-” *Call ends abruptly.*
Jaeger: “One moment, Jake is in trouble.” *Abruptly checks area with drone*
Drone does not come back
Jaeger: “Huh, We will not be joining them, the video feed showed Marckx being freed, anyways I win.”
At the lake
Marckx: “Jake, come, my arrival back was not as good as I thought, now to Deal with ryker’s slave.”
Zlo: “Marckx, don’t…”
The elders are thrown back against the trees
Marckx: “I am quite sorry about this wiziker, I know you did not want this to happen.” *Lifts into the air*
Ryker: *appears with a flash of lightning* “Don’t try anything.”
Marckx: “Ohhh, you, I am afraid your little game is only fun when the playing field is equal.” *Grabs onto a small pebble and it begins to glow* “I am not powerful enough to even harm you, but they might” *Throws stone into the lake*
Zlo: “No, not the portal”
The second the stone touches the lake a small sparkle forms on the lake then the statue of the 5 beings appear on the lake, at the base of them is an Organ
Marckx: *Sits down at the organ and begins to play*
The song is so familiar that it feels like home, and then the statue begins to break and a voice is heard from all over the world: “The Rogue was right, we are back!”
Marckx: *Him and the organ are surrounded by a blinging gold light and then a loud crack happens and it explodes outward*
5 beings in cloak’s appear and float slowly down
???: “We are the mage 10, we have returned, enemies of the light will bow.” *Disappears and takes the elders with them*
Dream: * appears where Y Ryker is with Arson.* “ hey. Were you playing uno?” 
Jaeger: “Yes, Jake is having fun with a released Marckx and 10 mage.”
Dream: “ well frick.” 
Arson: * eyes light up.* “ Can I set them on fire?!” 
The entire lake blasts outward and everything within 500 miles is soaked.
Dream: * has all the water pass through her.* 
Arson: “ water! Yuck!” 
Jaeger: *Stops water from flooding the city and builds wall/dam*
Dream: “ Can we play Uno too?” 
Arson: * nods.* 
Jaeger: “Yes, play with Y Ryker while I check the city and the wall.” *Leaves to do what he said*
Dream: “ yay!” * grabs some cards.* 
Arson: * grabs half the deck and sets it on fire.* 
Y Ryker: “That’ll make the game shorter!”
Arson: “ sorry. I haven't burned anything for hours. I had to burn SOMETHING!” 
Meanwhile
Where lake Michigan was is now a hole but before the bottom there appears to be a bright pink light.
Ryker: *ignores it*
Wiziker: *same*
The light then flashes brightly enough to disorient them for a minute and then it fades to nothing.
In ???
Marckx: “Did the Caviardé work at all?”
???: “Redigiert”
Marckx: “Is the hawk within range?”
???2: “Yes” *Says in heavy Russian Accent.*
???3: “Where will it happen”
???: “You know.”
Inbetween
Cancer:”the rotation is now established well enough to do it’s purpose”
Prophet:”I believe so”
They are standing on a balcony of the center tower overlooking the city. There now seems to be a wall at the edge of the city that seems to go up forever and down forever. It is bright and constantly changing color so fast that you can barely recognize that it is changing color. Between the colors it is black and dark.There is the occasional lighting strike that strikes one of the many lighting rods within the city.
Prophet:”someone with power has died”
Cancer:”hope it wasn’t anybody that we knew.”
Prophet:”there isn’t any way to tell right now”
Cancer:*looks through all of her links*”Lyra's has gotten weak. Almost non-existent.”
Prophet:”that is unfortunate”
Cancer:”yes, it is”*teleports outside the ‘wall’*
There are towers on either side of Cancer, one has a deer skull and the other an elephant skull. As she looks out away from the ‘wall’ everything seems dark, while there are the occasional shots of color going into the wall, and occasional color shots leaving. There is no ground.
Cancer:*makes a ground like solidness beneath her feet and she is now standing and staring out into the abyss. Tweaks the mist within the Inbetween a little bit more. Mind messages Prophet “would you mind going and checking on lyra? See exactly what condition she is in?”*
Prophet:*mind messages back”no I would not mind. I will go now, however I will need your assistance”*
Cancer:”I have no problem with that”*assists him to the library*
At the Liabrary
Prophet:*appears next to ‘lyra’*
Lyra’s body is gone. There’s nothing there.
Prophet:”hmmm. It appears that after one is dead and turned to dust I would assume, they leave behind a trace of their link.”*mind messages cancer, “Lyra is no more. Once one has died and turned to dust they leave behind a trace of their link”*
Cancer*mind messages back”We will have to watch out for this”*
Prophet:”yes, we will”
Wiziker: *fades into the inbetween*
He has a slight headache and a pressure is pushing down on him lightly
Wiziker: *mutters something about atmospheric density* “All right, Cancer. Let’s go.”
Cancer:*looks at him*”where?”
Wiziker: “To your demise.” *he glares at her*
Cancer:”well why would I want to do that?”
Wiziker: *doesn’t respond, and raises hand*
Cancer:”I don’t think that that is a very good idea”*seems to become transparent*
Wiziker: *guffaws* “You think changing your density does anything?”
Cancer:”no, I don’t. That’s not what I'm doing anyways”
Wiziker: “All right.” *energy blast directly at Cancer*
It goes through her disintegrating her, it goes into the vortex? And shoots out into the abyss, barely missing Wiziker. Pain shoots up his back and his head feels like it is going to burst. His powers feel distant. Everything seems to be crushing down on him
Cancer:*reforms*”Well? I told you that that wasn’t a very good idea”
The mist shifts
Cancer:*shifts it back*
The mist becomes …looser?
Cancer:*tightens it, looks for any outside force affecting the mist*
Well it’s not Wiziker.
Cancer:*sends a surge through the mist, stunning whatevers changing it”
It seems very …loose. Like giving up.
Cancer:*puts more fresh mist in*
Wiziker: *watching the events occur in much pain*
The mist seems to match the rest of it.
Cancer:*grumbles about people screwing with her mist*”Ryker, if it’s you, what are you trying to accomplish?”*emotionally boosts the mist and puts more in*
The mist solidifies slightly.
Cancer:*boosts the mist more with happy emotions*”Wiziker, was that a good idea, cuz that looks like it hurts”
Wiziker: *groans slightly* “It…s not me.” *He teleports away*
Cancer:”well good bye, hope to see you again soon!”*mind messages Prophet: ”I think that ryker was forcing Wiziker to try and kill everyone”*
Prophet:*back”of course it was, he’s the only one who has control over Wiziker really, who else did you think could do that?”*
Cancer:*back”i don’t know”*
Prophet:*back”think things through before you say them. Or before you decide on something to do. please.”*
Cancer*back”ok” boosts the mist more emotionally*
The mist swirls…as if disturbed.
Cancer:*glares at the swirly mist*”Wiziker. Ryker, whoever. Come out now, I don’t imagine that that feels very good, and your not doing a very good job at hiding”
The mist dissipates…slightly.
Cancer:*puts more in and adjusts the temperature to be slightly cooler. Boosts the mist more, and makes it solidify around the disturbance*
The mist almost is pushed out from the disturbance...forming a vaguely humanoid form
Cancer:*summons crystal rat, commands it to go to the human mist shape*
As soon as the rat gets near, the mist reforms to how it would normally be
Cancer:*humps happily?*”and stay away mist changer”*examines the rat without touching it*
It seems just normal…if not slightly calmer
Cancer:*examines the rat mentally, keeping up mental barriers*
Normal.
Cancer:*pokes rat with a random stick she got somewhere*
It seems agitated at the stick.
Cancer:*puts gem in stick and changes the stick to aluminium, it will pull anything out of the rat that shouldn’t be there*
Nothing.
Cancer:*changes the rat into a lightning rod with a gem and it gets to sit out in the abyss for eternity now. Teleports to Arson and Dream and Jaeger*
Newcago
Y Ryker: “Hey Cancer! Wanna play Uno?”
Dream: “ draw 2.” * places down a card.* 
Cancer:”perhaps. I just survived an encounter with wiziker, so I would like to talk to Jake, but for now, a good game of uno will suffice.”*grins at Y Ryker and sits down to play Uno*
The second she says Jake her phone rings
Phone: *Blairs Disco music.*
Cancer:*takes several attempts to answer, but does eventually*”Is this thing working?”
Jake: “Yes, anyways, I have to say, wiziker’s fighting seems to be getting more intentional. I have been tracking all of your mental energy, but his seems abnormally low, but his vitals seem to be more responsive.”
Cancer:”then the mist probably hit him harder than how much it actually had. Weird. I don’t know what could be causing this”
Jake: “No, I could not have been that, right before he came to you is when it started altering”
Cancer:”no, I meant when he was attacking me. He probably felt it more. It may also have been to lower the effects of the mist”
Jake: “I wonder if it is because…” *Pauses in the background she can hear glass breaking and marckx yelling: “Oh my gosh, that is the 5th one in like 10 minutes.”* “Sorry about that.”
Cancer:*sarcastically*”that’s fantastic”*normally*”It’s okay. So what were you going to say?”
Jake: “I was going to…” *pauses* *In frantic voice* “I need to go! We have a-” *Phone is disconnected*
Cancer:*looks at it pokes it some*”Is it broken? What happened?”*returns to playing Uno with Y ryker*
Hestuia: *watching them play Uno* “I’ll go check on him.” *fades away to Lake Michigan*
Cancer:*distracted*”bye”*sends in conspicuous bird to go watch*
The lake 
When he gets there the pink glow is still at the bottom
Hestuia: *looks around for Jake and Marckx*
Bird:*flies around in an updraft, watching, Cancer has to put all of her being into making sure that the bird doesn’t go for the shiny, or any shinies*
Hestuia has a strange draw to the pink glow.
Hestuia: *Looks at glow*
The pink light ends up being a portal.
Hestuia: “I hate what I always have to do.” *goes through portal*
Bird:*bolts through as well*
The bird is pushed back and can not seem to enter then a voice says only those who have touched dreams met enter
Bird:*squawks at the voice, continues to watch as commanded*
In the portal
Jake: “GUYS, JUST CALM DOWN IT DOES NOT MEAN ANYTHING!”
Marckx: “It could though, wait who is that” *Points at hestuia*
Hestuia: “Hey.”
Jake: “How did you get here?”
Hestuia: “The Portal.”
Marckx: “Jake, please tell me you didn’t leave it open”
Jake: “He told me to” *Points at one of the cloaked figures*
Hestuia: “So.”
One of the figures runs up to him
???: “You are a fellow time viewer.” *Bows*
Hestuia: *nods* “It’s a pleasure.” *puts Hand out to shake*
???: *Shakes his hand* “You, we’re not born with your powers, how did you get them? I do not recognise this magic”’
Hestuia: “I prefer to not directly state things about my personal life.”
???: “I understand, I will not pry, you know me by many names, The time keeper, Father Time, or the watchman, but you can call me tiktin”
Hestuia: *nods* “A pleasure, Tiktin.”
Tiktin: “Do you know of our plans? I am not sure if you can see timelines here, I have noticed it depends on the person.”
Hestuia: “My powers work in any part of time, space, or anything in between.”
Tiktin: “Who’s side are you for, Ryker or well anybody but him.”
Hestuia: “Whatever benefits me at the moment.”
Tiktin: “And as of late?”
Hestuia: *shrugs*
Tiktin: “I see. I think I now know…”
A small glass ball shatters
Tintik: *In a very old language says* “Can you not make a reality orb for the life of you! I swear even Radharc, your student, could make one faster than you!”
???2: “You know that I have not done it for over 10000 years!”
Hestuia: “Um.”
Jake: “Sorry, reality and space do not tend to go well together. Any news on Lyra?”
Hestuia: “Currently, She’s dead.”
Jake: “Then I was right.” *Pauses as an elder gestures to him* “I am afraid I need to have you leave. We can not have it happen too soon.” *Points to a gateway.*
Hestuia: *frowns* “Why would I affect anything?”
Jake: “I don’t know, He is just telling me, I have to follow him until I finish my time.” *Slips a small device into his back pocket.* “The hawk will always let you speak safe.”
Hestuia: *raises eyebrows, then leaves*
When he looks at the device and it says H.A.W.K
Bird:*is still flying around and watches hestuia come out of the portal*
Back in [REDACTED]
Jake: “Is it possible”
Tiktin: “I need some time” *Holding a Reality Orb* “The futures are all muddled. Ann, any luck finding them.”
Ann: *Says in heavy russian accent* “I can only find 3 possible links, I need at least 2 more to do it.” *Pauses* “YES! I found the other 2.”
Zlo: “Wait what.”
Tiktin: “Hush, you are now dismissed as leaders, we will take our roll now, should we fall, you can come back.” *Pauses* “We need to start as soon as we can”
Ann: “I agree.”
The 5 walk out of the portal and form a circle
Tiktin: *Sets the reality orb in the center of the portal*
Bird:*lands next to Tiktin, pecks the ground*
They all begin to chant and then Tiktin is hit with pale pink lightning, Ann is hit with black lightning, and the others are hit with various other colors.
All: “We promise to protect time!”
Bird:*flies away, circles a little ways away, watching them*
Ann: “Owww, why does it alway hurt so” *Gasps* *As she walks the ground under her temporarily pixelated* “It is BACK.”
Tiktin: “I can see it all much more clearly. Cory, what about you?”
Cory: “I can feel the atoms as if I am them. Farly can you?”
Farly: “I can feel your energy again. Aron?”
Aron: *Taps throat*
Cory: “Opps, here you go” *Hands him a small watch*
Aron: “Thank you, I think so” *Points at the sun and then points at a piece of wood.*
The light then focuses at the branch and it gets so hot that it bursts into flames even though the stick is super wet.
Aron: “Yes.”
Bird:*lands on a log in the lake a couple hundred feet away*
Cory: “SPY!” *Changes the atoms and the bird becomes a stone statue*
Tiktin: “Sorry, should have warned you.”
Bird:*falls over into lake, changes into a purple gem, it takes a second and the the bird glows cyan, and it seems to come alive again, flies out and stays a much further distance away*
Tiktin feels a bad feeling that something is…off.
Meanwhile
Dream: “ UNO!” 
Arson: “ WHAT! How?!” 
Y Ryker: “Well, I already won so.”
Dream: “ lol nope. You didn’t call UNO.”
Y Ryker: “Go fish.”
Dream: “ wrong game.” 
Y Ryker: *sadge*
Dream: “ go.” 
Y Ryker: “Go where??”
Dream: “ Let's light some stuff on fire. Jaeger didn’t stay and watch us.” 
Y Ryker: “YAY! BURN NEWCAGO TO THE GROUND!”
Arson: “ YEAH!!!!”* starts lighting fires.* 
Dream: * joins in.* 
Y Ryker: *joins in as well*
The city cannot be lit on fire, it is made of steel
Cancer:*is floating watching it burn, is keeping tabs on Bird*
Jaeger: *puts out fires* “Guys I told you to play UNO I am going to check out lake Michigan real quick.” *Heads to lake Michigan*
Cancer:*follows*
At lake Michigan
Cancer:*is floating way up in the sky*
Jaeger: *Heads to investigate the Light coming from the crater.*
Cancer:*follows*”be careful, they might blast you or something, I already had my bird get changed to stone once.”
Jaeger: “ I know. I also sent something to observe but I wanted to investigate it closer because I got a call from Jake that ended abruptly.”
Cancer:”I was just following you, but I got a call from Jake that ended abruptly as well”
Jaeger: “I’ll check first and I will try to let you know if anything bad happens.”
Cancer:”my bird can see if anything bad happens, but you can try to keep me updated as well.”
They hear A branch snap behind them and see the tail of a cloak
Jaeger: *Raises eyebrow* “Hello?”
???: “Ανελκυστήρας”
The ground under them begins to get pushed up into the air so high that even Jaeger is astonished looking down 5 beings float up to them
???2: “Servant of ryker surrender or face the punishment!” *Says in strong russian Accent*
Jaeger: “ I am no Servant of Ryker, he tried to kill me moments ago.”
???2: “Is he lying.”
???3: “No, he is only lying in 5 universes that are probable out of 500 so I believe we can trust him”
???: “Ohh, Sorry.”
Jaeger: “And you five are? With all due respect of course.”
???2: “Lower them.”
They drop down at ridiculous speeds
???2: “I did not mean that fast!”
???4: “Now, we are known as many things to different people, we are the 10 mage.”
Jaeger: “I see, what happened to Wiziker?”
???2: “He was not trustworthy.”
Jaeger: “Fair enough.”
Jake comes out of the portal
Jake: “Jaeger? Aron, when did they get here?”
Aron: “Just a few minutes ago.”
Jaeger: “I came to check the lake after the blast.”
???5: “Sorry my colleagues are not very good at talking about themselves. That is Aron, the person that made you shoot into the air is Ann, he is Cory, I am Farly, and that is Tiktin.”
Jaeger: “Where is Wiziker now?”
Cancer:*comes over, floats by Jaeger*”hullo”*bows quickly to the elders*”He tried to kill me not very long ago, and then he left and I don’t know where he went. The mist might still have him, it can take a while to wear off.”
Bird:*lands in tree nearby*
Tiktin: “I don’t like it here, something feels off.”
Cancer:”I bet it’s the mist depression. It’s this invisible presence that disturbs mist and tries to make it evaporate. I haven’t ever seen it outside of mist before though.”
Hestuia: *smirks*
Cancer:”what.”
Ann: “There are reasons we do not trust you.”
Cancer:”me, or hestuia?”
Hestuia: *chuckles*
Cancer:*sigh*”You aren’t going to tell me anything, are you? Probably not. I have just answered my question. Oh well.”
Tiktin: “All I can say safely is he is not all he seems.”
Cory: “Did anyone else just see that?”
Tiktin: “No”
Cory: “The light all went, strange.”
Farly: “Something about this place. I do not like it. I can almost feel it.”
Ann: “I wish I can help, I am too far out of this reality to feel much of anything.”
Cory: “Tiktin, can you tell us anything?”
Tiktin: “I” *Shutters* “This point in time is so strange, every path is wildly different from the next. I could not tell you.” *Mutters something about twisted timelines.*
Ann: “Guys, even if there is some evil near us, it is not like we are defenseless.”
Farly: “I think we would be safer if we recharge, that took way too much energy.”
The 10 mage form a half circle and begin to whisper some strange words and then they all float into that air.
Jake: “I am going to get the others.”
In Newcogo
Jake: “I need you guys to come with me.” *pauses and begins to talk softer* “There is something very wrong about this area, even the 10 mage are well aware of it.”
Hestuia: *continues chuckling* “None of you get it.”
Y Ryker: “CHECKMATE!”
Dream: * intentionally cheats to push Y Rykers buttons.* 
Jake: “Trust me, wiziker/ryker is not the reason they are unsettled.”
Cancer:”I’m starting to think that the mist depression is more than just that.”
Jake: “I will need you to come with me.”
Dream: “ but we're not finished with our game!”
Jake: “You can keep playing, I can take it with us.” 
Dream: “ Yay!” * knocks over Y Rykers queen.*
Y Ryker: *glares at Dream*
Jake: “This should only take a few seconds. If I can figure out how to use this thing” *Holds out one of Marckx’s creation* “I think this is how I…” *Presses a button on the device and them and the table are hit with a beam of light and they reappear into the Empty lake along with the table and the game*
Y Ryker: “BINGO!”
Dream: “ BINGO!” 
They all feel a strange sense of dread.
Dream: * begins laughing.*
Aron: “Can you feel that?” *Looks around*
Dream: “ yup.” * continues laughing.* 
Tiktin: *Gasps* “I…” *pauses* “It’s them.”
Aron: “Who where.”
Tiktin: *Mentally communicates with the other 10 mage: “More of us are here, our counterparts are near.”*
Aron: “How?”
Tiktin: “Was this lake known as something else around 1000 years ago? I can not see the past, only the future.”
Aron: “Look, that hill, is the same.”
Tiktin: “They are here, how though?”
Hestuia: “The past and the future are one in the same.” *scoffs*
Tiktin: “Yes, but still I need to confirm. Why have they not shown themselves.”
Ann: “You know why they are not. They are charging.”
Jake: “Who?”
Cancer:”yeah, who?”
Tiktin: “I can not say”
Dream: * knocks over Y Rykers King.* “ And I win, little Ryker.” 
Y Ryker: *lights chess table on fire*
Dream: * laughs and lights more stuff on fire.* 
Arson: “ FIRE!” * joins in.* 
Cancer:”Now is not the time for fire. Stop with the fire”*puts all of the fire out*
Dream: “ make us.” * lights more.* 
Cancer:*puts it out again, puts dream and arson in a circle of salt*”no. Not now.”
Arson: “ dang it Dream!” 
Dream: * laughs.* 
Cancer:*sighs*”well at least your contained for now.”
Y Ryker: *frees them from salt*
Dream: “ thanks little Ryker.” * starts fires.* 
Cancer:”oi.”*puts them back in the salt and puts Y ryker in a carseat with the buckles that you can’t undo*
Arson: *rams into the bariar trying to free himself. It fails.*
Y Ryker: *teleports three inches to the left and frees them again*
Arson: * runs off lighting fires as he goes.* “ NOT AGAIN!” 
Cancer:”BYEEEEEEE!!!!! I'll see you later and you won’t get any cookies or pickles, whichever you choose”
Arson: * is just running AROUND the room.* 
Y Ryker: *has cookies and pickles* “HA! I don’t need your cookies and pickles.”
Cancer:”oh. I think that I figured out why there are only 5 of them and they are called the 10 mage. There’s more of them here. I don’t think that they are nice.”
Dream: “ ok.’’ * lights more fires.* 
Cancer:”I’m done trying to stop you. The other 5 mages will probably vaporize you or something.”
Y Ryker: *scoffs*
Cancer:”they are your equal or more. I would respect them. Or at least not destroy their area. ”
Dream: “ YES! No one can contain our chaotic nature!!!” 
Cancer:”perhaps. But your chaotic nature will get you killed with these guys”
Dream: “ I'm a demon. There's little that can kill me.” 
Cancer:”that’s fine. These guys are part of the little that can kill you”
Dream: “ not necessarily.” 
Cancer:”whatever”*sits down and starts feeding Bird*
Arson: * lights bird on fire.* 
Bird:*doesn’t care*
Dream: * grabs out a bowl of cookie dough and eats it.* 
Arson: “ I WANT COOKIE DOUGH!!!” 
Dream: “ Come get some.” 
Arson: * eyes light up, he runs over and grabs a huge handful and eats it.* 
Dream: * to Cancer.* “ and that is how you contain children.” 
Arson: * nom nom nom.* 
Cancer:”you are a child as well, and you will see many of my tricks. I can try, but I have my doubts”*gives bird scritches under the chin*”Hey ryker, would you like the most fantastic pickle?”*pulls out a jar with the most fantastic pickles inside*
Arson: * tries to say something but he can't really talk because his mouth is full of cookie dough.* 
Y Ryker: *scoffs, snacking on all of his pickle-cookie dough.*
Dream: * eats more cookie dough.* 
Arson* suddenly gets really sleepy and falls asleep.* 
Cancer:”ok.”
Dream: * looks satisfied.* 
They all hear a loud screeching noise and then the ground shakes.
Tiktin: “Reveal yourself!”
Aron: “Are we powerful enough?”
Ann: “Not if they are fully empowered. If they are, well, look what happened last time.”
At lake Michigan
Jaeger: “What seems to be wrong?”
John: *Goes by Jaeger* “Hm?”
Jake: *Snaps and a strange pale armor come on him* “The 10 mage are…”
5 beings in pale white cloaks step out.
John: “Oh Come on, not again”
???: “Miss us Tiktin?”
Tiktin: *Goes pale* “Leave us!”
???: “Why would we do that, after all it is the 10 mage.”
Cancer:*is just sitting there, watching, quietly*
???: “You really thought we would just leave? No, when you sealed us in stone, we knew it would take a mistake to bring us back, so we altered the return spell so it would also unseal us”
Arson:*is asleep*
Jake: “Step down.”
???: “Now why would we do that?”
John: “Because I will do things to you, horrible things” *Feels important*
???: *Begins laughing* “A hummani! Not even Jake was brave enough to confront us like this!” *Still laughing* “Let's finish this battle here and now!” *Blasts shock wave at them*
John: *Vanishes*
Jake: *Blocks it*
Joe: * vanishes anyway*
The ground around them begins to warp
Aron: “No.” *Begins to reverse the reality warp*
The time around them begins to slow
Tiktin: “STOP!” *Begins hitting out beams of time*
Conor: “Alex, up to your old tricks I see!”
Alex: *Is shooting beams of darkness* “The world is better in DARKNESS!”
Cancer:*changes to original form, floats up some, watches*
Jake: “I need some help.” *Is fighting with a torivorien sword*
Jake: *Mentally sends message to arson and Yryker: “I need you to start the lake bed on fire.”*
Dream: “ well bye.” * grabs Arson and tries and fails to teleport away.* “ what?” 
Jake: “The other elders are trying to prevent power. Arson Light the lake bed on fire.”
Arson: * stirs and mumbles something.* 
Jake: “Arson, if you do this, I will buy you some goldfish!”
Arson: * sits up.* “  what?!” 
Jake: “Fine, I will buy you the 10 gallon one!”
Arson: * lights the lake on fire.* 
The atoms around them begins to collapse into one of the other 10 mage
Farly: *Points at the fire and begins to shoot up at one of the other elders.*
???2: “Σκοτεινή ύλη”
Cancer:*breathes lots blue fire at the bad 10 mage people*
Dream: “ Can I light fires too?!” 
Cancer:*around fire*”of course, now is a good time for fire”
Dream: “ YAY!” * lights fire.* 
The fire begins to flicker
Farly: “We need more!”
Arson: * breathes fire like a dragon.* 
Cancer:* is a original form (dragon), starts to glow brighter, her fire breath becomes more intense and there's just more of it, makes herself closer to proper size, lots more fire*
Anuite(One of the bad 10 mage) begins to attempt to pull away people's power
Conor: “Why don’t you try this on for size!” *Begins to emit shockwaves of raw power*
Anuite: “Your power is nothing to the symphony of the void!” *Begins to cover people's power.*
Cory: “Proelium ignis” *Sends out a wave of fire.*
Jake: *Begins to whisper in the torivorien toung*
A large platform made of dark obsidian begins to rise out of the flame
Dream: * lights more fire.* 
Jake: “Those of you who can’t fly get on the platform!”
Dream: * levitates.*
Arson: * does the same.* 
Cancer:*is still floating*
John: *Gets on platform*
Jaeger: *hovers at the level of the platform and sips tea*
Jake: “NOW!”
Right on que hundreds  of elders appear.
Anuite: “You are not the only one with an army!” *Whispers something in the language of the elders*
Hundreds of beings in pale cloaks appear
Jake: “ATTACK!”
Brightly colored beams of different magic begin to flash from each side
One of the elders in white cloak appears on the obsidian platform.
Adam: “Bow down or die!”
Ryker: *scoffs* “Mmm. No.”
Wiziker: *appears* “Wow! Everyone’s HERE!”
Arson: * looks scared.* 
Dream: * steps in front of him, prepared to protect him.* 
Wiziker: *smirks* “Let’s start with the weakest, shall we?”
Marckx: “*Appears behind Wiziker* *Shakes with rage* “You!”
A dark blue mist appears from his hand
Marckx: “You harmed my friends!” *The mist begins to grow into a dark plasma* “You killed the protected one!” *The plasma begins to form into a pure black staff* “You must be punished for your crimes against humanity.”
Hestuia: *clears throat* “Well technically…”
He waves the wand and Wiziker’s eyes turn pink briefly and he begins to see memories of when ryker first saw his universe.
Marckx: “Ryker is the problem, his goal will never be complete. His hunger for power will never be satisfied. Do not be deceived by his promise of being in control of your universe, he wants full control, you are just stretching out the inevitable.”
Ryker: *insulted* “I really would give you universes for helping me. I can’t control the entire multiverse on my own.”
Marckx: “This is a lie! He wants to feel all experience! That includes that.”
Ryker: *raises eyebrows* “Well if that’s what you think of me. All right.”
Marckx: “You can be freed again. All timelines have possibilities for this! Ryker is a supreme Dictator! He wants to feel all, Lazy Ryker is no longer in control. This means his goal is not possible! I can not undo it! But there are those who CAN! Look for the loopholes!”
Wiziker: *blasts Dream, catching her off guard*
Dream: * The blast goes straight through her.* 
Arson: * yelps even though the blast went through him as well.* 
Marckx: “Had to try” *Begins to whisper counter spells.* “Dang, I hate doing this.” *Yells out strange words.*
His power is all pushed into a sword.
Marckx: *Points sword at adam and he explodes into ash* “Shall we begin?”
Ryker: *appears* “Don’t try it, Marckx.”
Marckx: “Ryker, how about this, I hear you like deals. If wiziker beats me, I will never interfere with your plans. If I win, you must end these blasted games.”
Ryker: *chuckles* “Deal.” *his eyes become foggy*
Marckx: “You also may not take control of wiziker or interfere at all.”
Ryker: *eyes clear up* “Fine. Shake on it?” *hold out hand*
Marckx: “You must also agree to one last rule” *pauses* “You must also agree to fully release him from your control during this battle, you may not instruct him to do anything after the battle he can come back to your service, in return I will not kill him if the chance comes to that, but he may attempt to kill me.”
Cancer:*watches, creates an arena around them*
Meanwhile
Anuite: “Step down!”
Jake: “We will fall before I do that!” 
They both run at each other with a blade, Jakes is a torivorien sword with intricate symbols on it similar to his cloak, while Anuite runs at him with a blade that looks very simple yet it has a strange blue shine on it.
Jake: *Strikes his blade*
Anuite: “I see, you have quite the blade.” *Counter strikes*
Jake: “I am sure you recognize it.” *Jabs*
Anuite: “Yes, I believe I do.” *Grabs the end of the blade* “THis is the first torivorien sword”
Jake: “Yes” *Yanks the blade away from him* “I see you have a powerful blade as well” *Strikes*
Anuite: “Yes, it is made from My aura.” *Counters*
Jake: “You seem to have forgotten the first rule of sword fighting.” *Presses device to him* “Always bring a dagger”
Anuite is blasted away from Jake and ends up in the middle of a different fight.
Ann: “Step down comrade.” *still blasting magic at tolez(Other elder)*
Tolez: “Why would I do that!”
Ann: “I don’t know”
The battle between the light elders and the dark elders is only getting more intense.
Meanwhile
Ryker: *considers something* “But I still need to keep some attachments to him so he doesn’t run away on me.”
Jake: “I am okay with that, as long as you do not at all force him to fight or tell him anything else otherwise.”
Ryker: *raises eyebrows* “Fine.” *he holds out his hand again* “Deal?”
Cancer:*in original form and proper size, is sitting and watching from above.*
Marckx: “Deal” *Shakes his hand*
As soon as they shake hands a blast of pale blue light comes from their hands.
Ryker: *smiles* “Here we go…” *mutters stuff*
Wiziker: *glows with more power*
Meanwhile
Dream: * to all the children's mind messages ‘follow me’. She teleports away.* 
Arson: * nods and follows* 
Y Ryker: “Wait!” *he pulls out a hard drive* “I wanna see what’s on this first! I stole it from Kyle.” *follows*
Dream: “ So what's on it?” 
Y Ryker: *shrugs* “No idea.”
Arson: * impatient.* “ then find out.” 
Y Ryker: *plugs it into a computer, and Rain comes out the disc drive*
Dream: “ oh.” 
Rain: * looks around, and mutters *“ How did I get here?” 
Y Ryker: *shrugs*
Rain: “ Who are all of you?” 
Y Ryker: “I’m Ryker! Nice to meet you.”
Rain: “ that name sounds… familiar.” 
Dream: “ don’t you mean little Ryker?”  
Y Ryker: *glares at her* “No! My name is RYKER!”
Dream: * laughs.* “ Ok little Ryker.” 
Rain: “ Are you all siblings?”
Dream: * hugs Arson.* “ This is my little brother.” 
Y Ryker: “Um…I mean…no? Yes? I don’t know?”
Arson: “ well technically….”
Rain: “ uhhhh ok?” 
Dream: “ and he’s your… well what would you be, little Ryker?”
Y Ryker: “I mean…I’d guess probably Arsons…brother? I don’t really know. Maybe Ryker’s son?” *shrugs*
Dream: “ well your Arsons split personality so no. but i guess that makes you siblings.” 
Rain: * shakes head.* “ I don't have any siblings.* 
Y Ryker: *pauses* “So….?”
Dream: “ well your siblings now. Deal with it.” 
Y Ryker: *shrugs* “Okay.”
Rain: “ uhh ok.’’ * pauses.* “ Where are we?” 
Dream: “ this is reflections.” 
Y Ryker: “OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOH.”
Arson: * nods.* “ This is where we hid from Wiziker.” 
Y Ryker: “Wait….based on this…my brain has determined that Arson and Dream are mine and Rain’s cousins.”
Dream: “ ok. cool. “ 
Arson: “ yay! COUSINS!” 
Y Ryker: “So now that we have determined how we’re related, now what?”
Arson: “ fire?” 
Dream: “ YES!” 
Rain: “ no.’’
Evelin: “ no.’’ 
Y Ryker: “YES!”
Dream: “ ohhh i've got a better idea. Let's go to Newcago and burn it. Jaeger is busy so he can’t stop us.” 
Meanwhile
Wiziker: “Well let’s go.” *his hands glow with power*
Marckx: “Ψευδαίσθηση μνήμης” *Stabs sword into the ground*
John:”Not again!”
The area around them begins to shift, buildings begin to form around them everything begins to mold into lego bricks, then wiziker begins to see people from his past appear, and marckx disappears.
Wiziker: *blinks slightly* “Umm…all right.”
Wiziker sees himself walk past
Wiziker: *mutters something about lanozots*
Other Wiziker: *Can not hear him*
Other Wiziker begins to walk to the wizarding school, where he plans to teach a lesson.
Normal wiziker hears the voice of marckx in his head: “ahh yes, this was a very important day”
Wiziker: “This isn’t fighting. I was promised fighting.”
Voice in his head: “Ohh trust me, you will be fighting, just not yet.”
Other Wiziker arrives at the school.
Other Wiziker: “Today, I will teach the final spell you need to know: the copy spell. It tends to work for most circumstances, however, it seems to short out as we get further from the city borders. Who knows.” *pulls out a wand* “All you have to say is [Redacted].”
Carson: “[Redacted]” *Waves wand*
Other Wiziker: “Great!” *He leaves and returns to his house, a small island off the coast of the city.*
Wiziker: *sighs* “What do you want me to do, relive this day?”
Voice of Marckx: “You will see, this day must be played out to it’s fullest, then you will have the opportunity to fight.”
Wiziker: *sighs* “All right.”
Other Wiziker: *arrives, and settles down for the day, casting a spell around his home*
A while later, a large BLAST! Sounds at the police station
Other Wiziker: “Did Bazzaro Batman escape again?” *mumbles, and heads there*
After a little while he arrives, and the time portal is fizzling, shorting out. The police have cleared out of the building.
Other Wiziker: *sighs* “All right. Come out whoever you are. Is it you Traveler? I thought you died.”
The rumbling intensifies and Other Wiziker is sucked through the portal. His body begins to morph and change.
Wiziker: “Three…Two…On-”
Past Ryker: “Ah! Ryker! It’s a pleasure to meet you. Your immense power is heard about all through my realm. Unfortunately, I have to kill you now.”
Other Wiziker: “Wait!”
Past Ryker: *Disinterested* “What?”
Other Wiziker: “I’ve seen the creator.”
Past Ryker: “Creator?”
Other Wiziker: *scoffs* “The magical beings who are in control of the story.”
THE Author: “Oh! This is where I come in.”
Past THE Author: “Don’t harm him. He can aid you much better than any other Ryker.”
Other Wiziker: “See! I can help.”
Past Ryker: *sighs* “Can’t fight against the Author.” *he frowns* “Welcome to SOUR.”
Voice of Marckx: “Now, what if we change some things.”
The room moves back to when He sryker first revealed himself and then…
Past Ryker: “Ah! Ryker! It’s a pleasure to meet you. Your immense power is heard about all through my realm. Unfortunately, I have to kill you now.”
Wiziker feels himself become his past self, though this time his power seems to be magnified.
Past Ryker: *Atempsts to blast him with a beam.*
Wiziker: *blinks* “Ah. I see.” *he dodges, and waves his wand, covering the area in smoke*
Past Ryker: “Smoke” *Begins laughing* “This is nothing” *Waves hand and makes it disappear* “I am the master of this land scape”
Voice of marckx: “This place is in your MIND! You control this memory scape!”
Wiziker: *scoffs* “Okay genius.” *the landscape shifts entirely, resulting in Wiziker standing in front of Markx instead.*
Marckx: “I am still your master bow down to my mentality”
Voice of marckx: “This works also.”
Wiziker: *stops mental functions entirely*
Meanwhile
Cancer:”where’d marckx go?”*looks for him*
John: “I don't know one second i saw him the next he was gone”
Cancer:”okay, I guess he’s gone for now.”
Jake: “The spell is working. It, well, is quite dangerous for both of them” *Walks over to there bodies*
Dream: * appears.* “ Hey guys.” * starts lighting fires.* 
Arson: * appears also and joins in.* 
Jake: “They are now in stage 2.” *Casts protective spell on them.*
Cancer:”that means that it’s doing what it’s supposed to and doing good?”
Rain: * appears. gasps.* “ I did it!” 
Dream: “ good job.” 
Cancer:”What's your name, little one?”*is super tall above her*
Rain: “ uhhh.” 
Arson: “ It's ok. She's on our side.”
Jake: “I can not say. ”
Rain: “ cannot say what?” 
Cancer:”yeah, can’t say what?”
Jake: *Continues to cast protective spells on them*
John:”Can he hear us?”
Y Ryker: “OOOOOOH! IT’S WIZIKER LORE!”
John: *does a flip* “Cool”
Cancer:”yes. It is”*shrinks down to pony size, walks over to rain*”Would you like a ride, little one?”*kneels down*
Rain: “ no thankyou.” 
John: “I'll come”
Cancer:”okay.”*returns to proper size*
Arson: “ sooooo Fire?” 
John: “I like fire, can I help?” *lights finger on fire*
Arson: “ yes.” * begins setting stuff on fire.* 
Dream: * joins in.* 
John: *Lights stuff on fire*
Y Ryker: *lights stuff on fire.*
Cancer:”uh-”*contains fire, but they can still light fire*
Rain:* nervous.*  “ Maybe we should stop.” 
John: “Aw no more fun” *Lights on last thing* “okaaay im done”
Cancer:”you have sense little one. You still haven’t told me your name though”
Rain: “ um Rain.” 
Dream: “ cumon Rain. It's fun. Give it a try.” 
John: *Throws ball of fire at rain* “Here catch”
Cancer:*blocks fireball with tail*”you should ask her first whether or not she can interact with fire without burning herself, then go ahead”
John: “Can you?”
Rain: * mumbles.* “ no.” 
John: “Darn, i will be right back” *Vanishes*
John: *Returns with magic oven mitts* “Here”
 *He hands them to rain*
Rain: * looks like she's concentrating on something. Takes them.* 
John: “Rain Are you alright?”
Rain: “ yeah.”
Jake: “I have lost connection to the scape! I need to wake them” *Waves hand over them and they wake up* 
Cancer:”woah. Not good”
John: “Do you need us?”
Marckx: “He died. His mental scape is no longer active.”
Cancer:”that wasn’t the goal, was it…”*trails off*
John: *Interrupts *“Can we help him or… is he too far gone?”
Dream: * stops lighting fire.* 
Arson: * does the same.*
Dream: “ Whoa Wiziker died, AGAIN?!”
Cancer:*puts out random fires* 
John: “Just how many times has he died”
Suddenly Wizikers mental functions turn back on.
Jake: “He is back, how, wait, that is not possible.”
Ryker: “Not for a human.” *scoffs*
Jake: “Hold on, he, no, I mean it would explain a lot.” *Pauses* “Marckx, Zlo was right he, well.”
Markcx: “You are no live being are you?”
Wiziker: “Well…technically, no.” *he takes off his hat for a few seconds, and his mental functions shut off, and then he puts it back on*
Marckx: “How long have you been this!”
Cancer:*watches, hides the elder battle going on behind her with her wings*
Wiziker: “For a while….”
While this is happening
John:”Is this a recurring thing?”
Dream: “ yes.” 
John: “Have you found a cure or something?”
Arson: “ Dream?”
Dream: “ yeah.”
Arson: “ Can we go back to reflections?” 
Dream: “ sure.” 
John: “Can i come i feel like i'm in danger”
Dream: “ ok.” * takes Arson< John, and Rain to reflections.* “ Come if you want Little Ryker.” 
Y Ryker: *comes*
Meanwhile
Ann: “You foolish man!” *Creates a rift in the air and begins to overload Tolez*
Tolez: “It takes more than THAT!” *Changes the reality slightly* “You will not defeat me”
Under them the army seems to be perfectly matched
Cancer:*turns head 180 and looks over at the various battles happening and the army.*
Dream, John, Arson, and Y Ryker feel the area around them tremble
Y Ryker: “Ah…[explicit].”
Achievement: “Really! Wash your mouth out” *Young Ryker Suddenly has a bar of soap in his mouth stuck in there for 30 minutes.*
Dream: “ language sir.” * laughs.* 
John: “I thought we were safe?”
Dream: “ we are. I control this place.” 
 John: “So why do we feel tremors”
Dream: * shrugs.* 
John: “Alright I guess”
Arson: * giggles at the bar of soap stuck in Y Rykers mouth.* 
Y Ryker: “Suh…wha oin on?”
Dream: * laughs.* “ What was that little Ryker? I can’t understand you with that soup in your mouth.” * giggles.* 
Y Ryker: “Hats ot unny!” *he looks frustrated*
Dream: * giggles.* “ sorry I still can’t understand you.” 
Y Ryker: “Aaap! Aughing!”
Arson:* tries to stop himself from laughing and fails.* “ I’m sorry. It’s just so funny.” 
Dream: * laughs.*
Rain: * giggles as well.* 
Y Ryker: *embarrassed* “Aaaaap!”
Arson: “ oh ok.”
Dream: “ You're no fun.”* pauses.* “ maybe you should think of that next time you use that kind of language.” 
Y Ryker: *glares* “ooo a pea o [explicit].”
Dream: “ whoa. Keep that up and I’m sure you’ll have it in there longer.” 
Y Ryker *blinks* “Eye are oap in eye out?” *tries to spit it out but fails*
Arson: “ Sorry buddy. It’s really stuck in there.” 
Rain: “ my question is who put it there.” 
Y Ryker: “Eah! An eye?”
Rain: “ uhhhh?????? I don’t know what you're saying.” 
Y Ryker: *mind messages* “Why do I have soap in my mouth?”
Rain: “ because you said a bad word.”
Arson: “ Does that mean if any of us say a bad word we’ll have a bar of soap stuck in our mouths too?”
Y Ryker: *mind messages* “What bad word? [explicit]? People on TV say it all the time.”
Rain: “ yeah but that doesn't mean you should say it.”
Dream: * to Arson. * “ There's only one way to find out. So who wants to cuss? I would say little Ryker but he’s already spoken for.” 
Y Ryker: *mind messages* “Sorry soap being! I didn’t know!”
The soap vanishes
Ryker: “Huh. That worked.”
Dream: “ we’re did you come from?” 
Ryker: “I was bored.”
Rain: * to Y Ryker.* “ Does your mouth still taste like soap?” 
Y Ryker: *smacks lips* “Yeah…”
Arson: “ man that must suck.” 
Y Ryker: “Yeah! Stupid magical soap being.” *pauses* “So what’s wrong with reflections?”
Dream: “ I dunno.” 
Y Ryker: *looks around*
Arson: “ I'm still really confused about the soap. Is it all cusses or just * just barely stops himself from saying the bad word.* ?” 
Y Ryker: *shrugs*
Dream: “ I say we experiment.” 
Y Ryker: “Well I'm not doing it again.”
Rain: “ never.” 
Arson: * sighs.* “ Fiiiiine. I'll do it.” 
Rain: * covers ears.* 
Arson: * inhales.* “ [beeeeeeeeeeep.]” 
Y Ryker: “Well That’s a new one.”
Arson: * closes his eyes waiting for something to happen.* 
Y Ryker: *waits for a bit* “I…think you’re good….”
Arson: * sighs in relief.* 
Y Ryker: “So now what?”
Dream: “ you should say the other thing.” 
Arson: “ what do you mean [explicit]?” * realization.* “ oh frick.” 
Y Ryker: *waits, nothing happens* “How is this fair!”
Dream: “ I guess it's just the first person to say it.” 
Ryker: *shrugs* “I’ve…got to go.” *vanishes*
Dream: “ ok bye.” 
Arson: * sighs in relief.* “ I'm so glad I don't have to be forced to eat soap.” 
Y Ryker: *snacking on soap* “It is an acquired taste.”
Arson: “ I still don’t want to have a bar of soap stuck in my mouth for who knows how long.” 
Y Ryker: “Fair.” *pauses* “So what IS going on?”
Dream; * shrugs.* “ where questioning an odd phenomenon of when a bar of soap got stuck in your mouth.” 
Y Ryker: “no I mean with Reflections.”
Dream: “ I don't know. Odd stuff happens all the time here.” 
Y Ryker: *shrugs* “Okay. So now what?”
Arson: * shrugs.* 
Y Ryker: *looks at Rain* “What do you wanna do?”
Rain: * shrugs.* 
Y Ryker: “Well this is boring.”
Dream: “ we could trap Arson in a circle of salt and watch him try to escape.” 
Y Ryker: *snaps and a ring of salt appears around Arson* “Ha!”
Arson: “ NO!!” * tries to ram himself against the barrier.* * LET ME OUT!!!!” 
Y Ryker: *thinks about it* “No.”
Arson: “ why?!” 
Y Ryker: “Cause it’s funny.”
Arson: “ no it's not!!!” * punches the barrier.* 
Y Ryker: “What do you think Rain, is it funny?”
Rain: * giggles.* “ kinda.” 
Arson: “ uhhhhh! You all SUCK!” * tries one more time to free himself then sits down facing away from them and pulls hood over head.* 
Y Ryker: *whispers to Rain* “Wanna do it to Dream?”
Dream: “ lol nope.” * disappears.* 
Y Ryker: “Let’s go.” *teleports himself and Rain to wherever Dream went, leaving Arson behind*
They don’t go anywhere. 
Y Ryker: “Let’s go.” *teleports himself and Rain to Newcago went, leaving Arson behind*
They still stay in the same place. 
Y Ryker: “Um…what’s going on?”
Rain: * shrugs.*
Who: * appears.* “ Hey chicken face!”
Arson: * gets an idea. He takes the hoodie string out of his hoodie and uses it to move the salt enough for him to free himself. Scrambles out of the barrier.* 
Y Ryker: “Something’s wrong.”
Arson: * out of breath.* “ na nothings wrong. See.” * tries to create fire and fails.* “ oh no.” 
Y Ryker: “Yeah…”
Rain: * a little freaked out.* “ What's going on?!” 
Y Ryker: “I blame Arson.”
Arson: “ Why me?! You're the one who put me in a circle of salt! I didn’t do anything!” 
Y Ryker: “You did something…” *narrows eyes in mock suspicion*
Arson: “ what could I have possibly done?!” 
Y Ryker: “DREAM! HELP!”
Dream: * laughs.* “ What do you need help with?”  
Y Ryker: “Our powers aren’t working!”
Dream: * giggles.* “ I know.” 
Y Ryker: “What did you do!?”
Dream: * laughs.* “ I made it so only my own powers work in reflections.” 
Y Ryker: “So I can’t leave!?”
Dream: “ yup.”
Y Ryker: *sarcastic* “Wow. That’s great.”
Rain: * surprisingly calm.* “ But why?”
Dream: “ because it’s funny.”
Y Ryker: *annoyed* “So what are you going to do?”
Dream: “ I don’t know.” 
Y Ryker: “Don’t try anything funny.” *narrows eyes*
Dream: “ why not? You can’t do anything.” 
Y Ryker: “I can’t do anything, ha!” *sticks out hands, and does nothing* “Oh…right.” *he frowns* “Um…yeah. Don’t try it!”
Dream: * giggles.* 
Arson: “ oh no. See little Ryker! It’s not my fault!” 
Y Ryker: “Of course it is! You distracted me, or I would have stopped her.”
Dream: “ nope. This is actually on you.” 
Y Ryker: “Me!”
Dream: “ it was your idea to try and trap me. I wouldn’t have done any of this if you hadn’t.” 
Y Ryker: *muttering* “Stupid Arson.”
Arson: “ hey!”
Dream: * laughs.* “ you still blame it on Arson. Ok.”
Rain: “ uhhh…” 
Y Ryker: *sits, bored*
Arson: * mutters something.* 
Dream: * laughs amused.* 
Y Ryker: “So what are you gonna do now?”
Dream: “ I dunno. I just thought this would be plenty funny but I’m open to suggestions.” 
Y Ryker: *shrugs* “I can’t stop you from doing anything to mess with me, so it’s up to your imagination.” *slightly panicked*
Dream: * shrugs.* “ like I  is said I don’t know.” 
Y Ryker: *calming down slightly* “You couldn’t come up with a good idea even if it hit you on the head.”
Dream: * shrugs.* “ ok.”
Y Ryker: *pauses* “You’ll…just take that? No revenge? Nothing? Wow. You’re way too nice.”
Dream: * shrugs.* “ I don’t care about insults. Nothing you say can ever hurt my feelings if I don’t let it.” 
Y Ryker: *shrugs* “At least you can’t humiliate me any more.”
Dream: “ one who ever said I wanted to? And two you looked pretty humiliated with that soap in your mouth.” 
Y Ryker: “Well why else would you do it…” *pauses* “And the soap wasn’t as bad as being THIS helpless.”
Dream: “ I did this because one it’s funny two you aren’t that helpless.” 
Y Ryker: “Just you wait. It tends to get worse as it goes on.”
Dream: “ ok fine. If you don’t try anything I’ll let you use your powers again.” 
Y Ryker: *lying* “Fine.”
Dream: “ I can read your mind. I’m not stupid.” 
Y Ryker: *scoffs* “No! I would rather sit in this humilia-humilia-huwiatin tan no git revenge.”
Dream: * giggles.* “ You good little Ryker? You're struggling to speak well.” 
Y Ryker: “I can spik yus fine!”
Arson: * giggles.* “ You sound like you are 5.”  
Y Ryker: “You This many!” *holds up 5 fingers*
Arson: * begins laughing.* 
Dream: * giggles* “I didn’t expect that to happen.”
Y Ryker: *seems slightly unbalanced* “Hey stap mak fun o me!”
Arson: “ I’m sorry. It’s just funny.” 
Y Ryker: *falls down, and begins crying*
Dream: “ ok I’m sorry.” 
Y Ryker: *body begins to shrink in size*
Dream: “ alright enough.” * let’s everyone use there powers again.* 
It’s too late. You brought this upon yourselves.
Y Ryker: *shrinks to the size of a 12 month old, continues sobbing*
Dream: “ ok lol.”  
Y Ryker: *babbling and blubbering*
Rain: “ awww he’s cute.” 
Y Ryker: *smiles at Rain, happily*
Dream: “ Rain? Do you think you could fix him?”
Rain: “ I dunno.” 
Y Ryker: *flops over toward Rain, then cries*
Rain: * picks him up.* “ Now he really is little Ryker.” 
Dream: “ ok.” 
Y Ryker: *chuckling, happy*
Rain: * tries to use her powers to fix y Ryker’s age.* 
Fails due to unspecific usage
Y Ryker: *looks at Rain in curious way, then babbles like he’s talking to her.*
Rain: “ I wonder if he still thinks like little Ryker.” 
Y Ryker: *giggles happily*
Dream: “ I think that if he did he would have aged himself back.” 
Y Ryker: *looks at Dream in curiosity*
Rain: * tries again to copy someone’s power to try and fix Y Ryker’s age.* 
There’s no one nearby with that skill set.
Rain: “Well there’s nothing I can do. Maybe Ryker can fix him.” 
Y Ryker: *giggles happily at Dream, reaching for her*
Dream: “ uhh hi.” 
Y Ryker: *tries climbing out of Rains arms to get to Dream*
Dream: * shrugs.*
Rain: “ I think he wants you.” 
Y Ryker: *squirming against Rain’s grip*
Rain: * let him go gently.* 
Y Ryker: *flops down on the ground, immobile, and begins to sob*
Dream: “ ok fine.” * picks him up.* 
Y Ryker: *giggles with joy, and gropes Dream*
Dream: “ Hey Ryker!” 
Y Ryker: *holds on tighter*
Dream: “ no not you. The other one.” 
A small note floats down: “Busy, can’t help right now with whatever you need. At the fold of the paper, please leave a message.” *paper folds*
Dream: * writes: “ little Rykers a baby now. We need you to turn him back.”* 
The paper folds up extremely small and vanishes
Y Ryker: *grabs pen (or pencil) and pokes Dream in the eye*
Dream: * watches as it goes through her.* 
Y Ryker: *waves hand through her, then begins to cry*
Dream: “ I’ve changed my mind. He might still think like little Ryker.” 
The paper unfolds, and reappears.”Stop making fun of Ryker and leave me alone unless you have something actually important to tell me.” The paper vanishes
Dream: “ ok fine. I already said I’d stop.” 
Y Ryker: *tries to grab onto Dream*
Dream: * is still holding him.* “ I’m sorry for teasing you Ryker.” 
Arson: “ me too.”
Y Ryker: *reforms to his normal self* “Thank you.” *he grins slyly* “You don’t mess with me.”
Dream: * giggles.* “ fair.” 
Y Ryker: “I wonder what the others are doing.”
Dream: “ we could watch.” 
Y Ryker: “Sure. Do we want to watch the elders or Wiziker?”
Arson: * quickly.* “ Elder battle.” 
Y Ryker: “All right.” *teleports the group there*
Dream: “ I meant through reflections but ok.” 
Back with the elder battle
Cancer:*stops blocking out the elder battle with her wings*
Marckx, Jake, and anyone else who is still there are blasted by the sound of battle
Child Gang: *appears*
Dream: “ Hey guys.” 
The eternal one: “ IM back”
Xin: “ ahhh it's good to be the original, don't you think ryker.”
Xin: “ hey who are the old guys and the baby”
John: “What's with the gang of children”
Arson: “ We're children so we prefer to stick together.” * Hugs Dream.* 
Xin: “okay”
Dream: “ hey Xin. also what baby?” 
John: “I see” 
Xin: “that one” *points at ryker*
Ryker: *not there* *Ends up being john*
John: “HEY!”
Dream: “ Rykers not a baby.” 
John: “He's just emotionally unstable and short” *Smirks*
Cancer:*plods over and sits down near them*
Dream: * laughs.* “ Did you just call Ryker short?! Also, which one do you mean?” 
John: “Yes I did,all of them”
Cancer*pats Y ryker*
Xin: “everyone calm down”
Dream: “ no.” 
John: *Anger* “Who are you, I have never even seen you!” 
Xin: “ im older than you so shut up”
Dream: “ make me.” 
John: “I have no age, I'm ageless.”
Xin: “i've been around since page 7 of the first doc”
John: “Doc? What's a doc? This is real life bro”
Dream: “ ok. Im 12.” 
Xin: “rookie, also dream you came in the 2nd or 3rd doc so you're still pretty old”
Dream: “ No, I'm only 12.” 
Cancer:”hmm. I've been here since the first doc.”
THE Author: “I would prefer it if you didn’t break the fourth wall.”
The fourth wall’s body flies though this dimension at impossible speeds before leaving
John: “Why does this exist?”
Arson: “ because yes.” 
Cancer:”because”
□︎⬥︎♏︎■︎ 🕈︎□︎❒︎🙵❍︎♋︎■︎:”🕈︎♒︎⍓︎ ■︎□︎⧫︎✍︎”
Xin: “ because it does, also I'm still older than you cancer”


author: “Why are you like this”
Dream: “ I never broke the fourth wall soooooo.” 
Cancer:”and?”
Author: “I was referring to Xin”
Xin: “why”
Arson: “ because you broke the 4th wall.” 
author: “You shall pay for the crimes against the council of authors”
Cancer:”oof”
The scene changes to a courtroom
Arson: * goes to the back to nap rather than paying attention.* 
Cancer:*goes to the back and crushes all of the chairs in the back by sitting*
Author: “How do you plead”
Xin: “ why would I plead this was never approved so you cannot alter the story to kill me. You need a 2/3rds vote you got 3 out of 10 making it around a 1/6th vote”
Cancer:”I approve a trial”
John: “  I approve a trial”
Dream: “ I don't care.”  
xin: “ that leaves 7 more people to vote”
Arson: * is asleep right now.*
Y Ryker: “I say we don’t have a trial and just banish him.”
Ryker: “Same.”
John: “I agree”
Cancer:”mmmm. Some taste ye have. I agree.”
Dream: “ i still don’t care what we do.” 
John: “How do we banish him, so that he doesn't escape?”
Cancer:”ryker.”
John: “Can I Consume him?”
Xin: “ was done breaking the 4rth wall I just needed a good joke for 2 sentences”
Cancer:*lays down, crushing more chairs*
John: “”Can I Consume Him?
Xin: “what good would killing me off do?”
Simon: “[insert nerdy reference her]”
Dream: “ I don't know. That's why I'm not voting.” 
John: “It would fill me up?”
Xin: “ yes you would be full but you would have ended a life without cause.”
John: “The cause is that i'm hungry and you broke the rules”
Cancer:*waves talon and a whole basket of boneless chicken wings appears in front of him*
John: *Shows his sharp teeth* “ Yummy”
xin: “ I'm afraid that I missed those rules. Where are they stated? The ones about not breaking the fourth wall”
Simon: “I’m the only one allowed to break the fourth wall. Zonai.”
Dream: “ eat raw cookie dough. Its much better than people.” * eats cookie dough.* 
John: *Licks lips * “Owwww My tongue” 
Xin: “ why are you being so savage”
John: “I just am” *Grins and hair flip*
Dream: * eats more cookie dough.* 
Xin: “ well please consider others before you actions”
John: “Thanks for chicken”
Xin: “there you go”
Cancer:”your welcome”
John: “Was that from KFC??”
Cancer:”no, boneless chicken wings”
Dream: “ I want KFC mac and cheese.” 
John: “Me too, lets go get sum”
Cancer:”ok, climb aboard”*walks over and kneels down*
John:  *gets on*” I do that”
Xin: “ okay you have fun now”
Dream: *Caries Arson over to Cancer and climbs on.* “ Arson, get up!” 
Arson: “ hmmm?” 
Dream: “ we're getting food.” 
Arson: * mumbles.* “ ok.” 
Cancer:*stands up and they shoot over to a random KFC in NewCago and they all get food*
THE Author: “We’re done here. Back to the plot.”
Afterwards
John: “That was good, now what?” 
Cancer:”we wait”*sits down*
John: “For some enemy?” *Lays down to see the sun*
Cancer:”i dunno”*points over to the elder battle still going on*”we can watch that”
John: “Alright” 
Arson: * lays down and goes back to sleep.* 
Dream: “ you're still tired?”
Arson: * mumbles something sleepily.* 
Dream: “ I'm bored.” * starts lighting anything on fire that can burn in Newcago.*
Cancer:*is sleeping but listening to the battle*
Currently in the battle
Marckx: “MOVE TO PLAN B!” *Begins to whisper a strange incantation.*
The Ground around them begins to tremble. A strange black mist begins to pour out of his hands.
Marckx: “Beings of the mist! Your time has come! Remove tenebris unum.” *Pauses*
Strange cries begin to come from the mist behind him. Marckx points at wiziker, then his hat.
Jake: *Looks nervous.* “He, he, s-s-summoned the mist being.”
As soon as he says this the battle around them begins to stop as the elders surround the arena.
Anuite: “How”
Jake: “He is fueling the spell with his own power. This must be draining him severely.”
Ann: “Can he control it?”
Anuite: “At one point right before pugna petrarum, We were getting desperate and we decided to try and summon it. We were able to begin the spell but, not even all of our power combined could fully control it, we ended up reversing the spell.”
Jake: “I can only wonder, does wiziker know what he did?”
Tiktin: “No. He is aware of some things but not all, he believes an ally will come, but he is not aware of the mist being.”
Ann: “What will we do if it gets loose?”
Anuite: “We are all doomed.”
Tiktin: “The age of the mist would be, difficult, I would rather face the most evil form of ryker than fall into the age of mist.” *Pauses* “If you are wondering, We only have a 15% chance of this going correct.”
Ann: “Can we know some of the outcomes?”
Tiktin: “Yes, In some we are right and Wiziker… you know, in one ryker absorbs the mist.” *Shutters* “In all of those, we all die, and I mean every one. In another the mist manages to work, but at the end he loses control, this is about 80% of the futures.”
Cancer:*comes and sits on the edge of the arena, listening.*”I believe when I say that I would rather not die, I speak for all of us”*watches the battle below*
Jaeger: “Is there anything I can do to help?”
Cancer:”I don’t think that there is anything that we can do, It is up to the luck of the draw at this point”*gestures at Marckx and the mist.*
Parts of the mist begin to condense into a form
Jake: *Hops into the arena and begins to help Marckx* “The virus of the mist, attack the inhumane one” *Also points at wiziker*
The mist begins to push over to wiziker all the 10 mage jump down and help with the spell
All: “Being of the mist heed our word! Destroy the inhumane one”
The mist goes into his hat
Dark Wiziker: “Step down Wiziker. I can take it from here.”
Wiziker: “No. Initiating split data frame.” *suddenly the Dark Wiziker mainframe is split from Wiziker*
Dark Wiziker: “Hello, I am your”
Wiziker and Dark Wiziker begin to fight for control
Outside
Jake: “This is our chance!” *Runs over to wiziker and grabs his hat.*
Ann: “We have to destroy the mist!”
Marckx: *Is lifted up into the air still chanting*
Tiktin: “He can not stop it now.”
Ann: “I know how.” *Hold out a dagger made of a strange crystal substance.*
Jake: “This could work. It should be enough to kill the mist and stop him.”
Ann: “Now” *Hits it with the knife*
The hat trembles, and quivers, It begins to tear in half
Tiktin: “NO!”
Out of the hat the dark mist begins to blast into the air. Wiziker Lifts into the air and dark wiziker and him merge into one.
Marckx: “Mistic arts of power heed the word…”
Tiktin: “That was the paradox knife! What have you done!”
The wiziker paradox is created. It is an adaptation of Arrow’s paradox, Given more than two choices, no one can have all the attributes of an ideal voting system at once. Dark wiziker, Wiziker and Light Wiziker are born.
Mixed Wiziker: “We are 3 that are one and one that is 3.”
Wiziker: “WELL EXCUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUSEEEEEEEEE ME PRINCESS!”
Dark Wiziker: “I can take control if you would like”
Light Wiziker: “No, I can.”
Wiziker: “Neither of you are in control. I am.”
Dark Wiziker: *Blasts light Wiziker* “Ow!”
Light Wiziker: “OW!”
Outside his head.
Jake: “He is losing control over the mist guys!”
Dream: “ uhhhhh ok?” 
Wiziker: “Shutting down Wiziker protocol. Reuploading database.”
Arson: * gets up, looks at Wiziker then backs away.*
Marckx: *Begins to lose control over the spell*
The mist shifts slightly, condensing.
Jake: “What’s that?”
Dream: “ I-I dunno.” 
Arson: * scared.* “ Dream!” 
The mist forms into a humanlike shape.
Arson: * still scared.* “ DREAM!” 
Dream: “ Arson! I'm here.” * grabs his arm.* 
Arson: * hugs onto Dream.* 
The form slowly becomes more solid
???: *timid, warped voice* “Hello?”
Arson: * clings to Dream harder.*  
???: *still warped* “Dream? Arson? Jake? Hello?”
Dream: “ hello?” 
The mist reforms into Lyra’s form
Lyra: “Hello? Can you see me?”
Dream: “ yes.” 
Arson: * looks up at Lyra.* 
Lyra: *smiles* “Hi everyone!”
A strange thing comes out from behind lyra
Jake: “RUN!” *Grabs Marckx and begins to sprint.*
Jaeger: “Yeah, bye.” *Leaves*
Dream: * takes Arson and Rain to reflections.* 
Cancer:*vanishes to the Inbetween, watching the events*
The thing looks like a metroid, yet something is off, it is pure reflective black, It goes into ont of the elders, His eyes turn red and he begins whispering a strange spell, More dark mist pores out of the elders hand.
Tiktin: “The age of the mist has begun!”
Present Author: “DUH DUH DUNNNN!”
Y Ryker: “Wait!” *teleports to Reflections*
Ryker: *teleports general rest of group to SOUR*
Arson: * freaked out.* “ What are we going to do?!” 
Dream: “ It's ok Arson.” 
Arson: * whimpers and grabs onto Dream.* 
Evelin: “ It's ok Arson.”
Arson: * freaked out.* “ how?! There’s a big smoke monster that’s going to kill us!” * hyperventilates.* 
Evelin: “ Arson. You need to c-“
Arson: “ NO!” * freaked out.* 
Evelin: “ I’m sorry Arson.” * puts hand on his head.*
Arson's eyes glow blue. He falls unconscious. 
Evelin: * keeps one hand on his head.* 
Y Ryker: “Whoa what just happened?” *pauses* “What did you do…” *he steps back fear apparent in his eyes* “Rain…let’s go…something’s off with Evelin and Dream…”
Evelin: “ oh calm down. He’s fine. I’m just giving him a dream.”
Y Ryker: *narrows eyes* “No you aren’t…. Rain….who do trust?”
Rain: “ I trust all of you.”
Y Ryker: *slowly backs away from both of them*
Evelin: * sighs.* “ I’m just trying to calm him down. It works with Dream so I thought it would for Arson too.” 
Y Ryker: *continues backing away* “The last time someone messed with dreams…” *trails off*
Evelin: “ ok. believe what you want. I'm not going to hurt you.” 
Y Ryker: *teleports away*
Rain: * shrugs.* 
Evelin: * sighs.* “ I know what I’m doing.” 
A few minutes go by. As they do Arson seems more calm and relaxed.
Evelin: * takes hand away.*
Arson: * wakes up.* “ whoa, what happened?”
Evelin: “ Well you were freaked out so I put you to sleep and gave you a dream because you can’t dream naturally.”
Arson: “ whoa. That was… amazing.” 
Y Ryker: *head appears, and looks around* “Are you okay Arson?” 
Arson: * confused.* “ yeah. I’m fine.” 
Y Ryker: “Blink twice if you need help.”
Arson: * doesn't blink.* 
Y Ryker: “Oh I get it! Evelin’s controlling your mind. Evil. She’s an evil genius. I’ll save you later.” *vanishes*
Evelin: “ why would I do that?!”
Arson: “ Are you controlling me?”
Evelin: “ no. I don’t have the power to do that. The only one I can control is Dream. But that’s because we share a body and it’s not easy.” 
Arson: “ uhhhh ok.”
Rain: “ Well whatever you did you freaked out Ryker.” 
A small note with bad handwriting lands in Rain's hands: “If you need help, say Banana.”
 Rain: * folds it up and puts it in her pocket.*
Dream: * mumbles something.*
Rain: “ What was that?”
Dream: “ I hate being shoved in the dreamscape.”
Arson: “ Welcome to my world.”
Dream: * laughs.* “ your world? You don’t share a body any more.” 
Y Ryker: *appears* “It’s go time.” *He grabs Rain and teleports them to a small pocket dimension.* “Are you okay? Did Evelin get in your head too? When you didn't say banana I got worried.” *he continues rambling, concerned*
Rain: “ I’m ok. She didn’t even touch me.” 
Y Ryker: *looks straight into her eyes, his gaze shifting* “I…I…I…” *he lets out a bit of a panicked scream, and then falls down on the floor, unconscious*
Rain: “ Ryker! Are you ok!” * shakes him.* 
Y Ryker: *just limp, not responsive*
Rain: “ RYKER!!!!!” * shakes him again. Then goes and gets a bucket of water and throws it at him.* 
Y Ryker: *still unconscious, mumbling* “No…NO!” *he jolts, but remains unconscious*
Rain: * waits for something to happen.* 
Y Ryker: *shaking, screaming in pain*
Rain: “ Ryker!!!” 
Y Ryker: *mumbling* “Dream…Arson…”
Rain: “ It's ok Ryker.” 
Y Ryker: “Get…”
Rain: * waits.* 
Y Ryker: “Dream…” *he stops moving*
Rain: “ DREAM!!!!”
Dream: * appears.* “ yeah? ”
Rain: “ Ryker wanted me to get you. He freaked out and went unconscious.”
Y Ryker: *moaning in pain*
Dream: * gently touches his arm.* “ Ryker? Are you ok?”
Y Ryker: *screams*
Dream: “ Ryker?!” * shakes him.* 
John: *To Cancer* “This show got better”
Cancer:*mind messages from inbetween,”yes, yes it did”*
The dark mist begins to seep into the reflections
Tiktin: *Begins to laugh* “The age of the Mist will be a dark one!”
Too bad only Arson is in Reflections.
Arson: * sees the mist and teleports away to Dream and the others.* 
Jake: “I must warn you, whatever you do, do not breathe in the mist, that includes you ryker.”
Ryker: *scoffs* “A little mist. I’ll just separate it. Or just pull out some antimatter.”
Jake: “Umm, separating it makes it worse, also, umm you can try antimatter, I do not know how well it will work but, you can try.”
Ryker: *antimatter go brr at mist*
Marckx: “Oh gosh”
A small amount of the mist disappears.
Ryker: *an enormous amount of antimatter go brr at mist*
Meanwhile
Arson: “ YOU GUYS!! There's mist in reflections!!” 
Dream: “ Mist?”
Arson: “ yeah like the one that came from Lyra!”
Rain: “ you didn’t breathe any in though right?” 
Arson: * shakes head.* “ I teleported away before it could get close to me.” 
Cancer:*appears*”that’s good”
Y Ryker: *still convulsing on the ground*
Arson: “ Is he ok?!”
Dream: “ I don’t know.” 
Cancer:*offers up cookie dough to Y ryker*”He might be faking it, hopefully he is, but if not, I don’t know”
Arson: * looks nervous.* 
Cancer:*gives pats and cookie dough*
Dream: *  walks over to Arson and hugs him.*
Arson: * hugs her back.*
Y Ryker: *gagging and sobbing*
Rain: “ RYKER!!” 
Cancer:”did you breathe in any mist ryker?”
Y Ryker: *motionless again*
Cancer:”how do we know if he breathed in any mist?”*is looking down over him. *
A slight chuckle can be heard from somewhere in the room
Cancer:”lovely, mist man, go away, I have had enough of you.”*many gem rat’s appear and wander around the room*
Lyra: *appears and looks at Y Ryker* “Whoa! What’s wrong with him?”
Cancer:”he started convulsing and stuff and he might have breathe in the mist, but I think that it’s the mist phantom that has been ‘haunting’ me”
Lyra: “Um…I was the mist phantom.”
Cancer:”oh, ok. Well then I don’t know. I think that there is another phantom now.”
Gem Rats:*continue to wander and survey the room*
Lyra: *looks at Y Ryker, and then immediately teleports away*
Dream: “ Does ANYONE have any idea what to do?!” 
Arson: * trembles.* “ nwod mlac “”t’nac I! Nwod mlac t’nac I!!!!” 
Dream: “ Are you ok?” 
Arson: “ !!!!!ON !!!!!!Tuo gnikaerf mI “
Rain: “ what are you saying?’’
Dream: “ he says he's freaking out.” 
Rain: “ how do you know what he’s saying.”
Dream: “ It's pretty easy.”
Arson: “ od ot gniniog ew era tahw?!!!!!!”
Dream: * shrugs.* 
Y Ryker: *screams*
Arson: * hyperventilates.* “ od ew od tahw?! Od ew od tahw?!” 
Dream: * sighs.* “ Where's Jaeger when you need him? He’s supposed to be watching us.” 
Jaeger: *Appears* “I’m back with the milk!”
Dream: “ well Rykers kinda dying and Arsons freaking out sooooo….” 
Jaeger: *Hands Arson paper bag and Picks up Y Ryker Carefully*
Arson: * lights bag on fire. Seems too calm down a little.* 
Jaeger: *Brings more Napalm for Arson* 
Xin: “calm down with the jelly/jam”
Jaeger: “Fire Seems to calm him down.”
Xin: *spreads napalm on his sandwich* 
John: “Why are we doing this?”
Xin: “why not”
John: *Pulls out nuke* “Can I help?”
Jaeger: “Arson is having a panic attack and fire calms him down.”
John: *Hands nuke to arson* “Here you go”
Cancer:*makes a container to keep the nuke from exploding everything outside of where they are*
John: “Aw no fun” *Frowns*
Y Ryker: *convulsing on the floor, although NO ONE IS PAYING ATTENTION TO HIM! (Jerks)*
John: “Can I nuke him though, pleeeeease?” *Points to ryker* 
Jaeger: “No, I need to check his vitals and make sure he is okay.” *Makes sure to check pulse breathing* “Dream I might need you to inspect his mind.”
Dream: “ Ok tell me when.” 
John: “I can do that “*turns to ghost (More like a lT)*
Cancer:”blowing up a nuke right next to an unstable ryker is probably not a good idea”
John: “Aw fine”
Cancer:”you can do it later when ryker is better or we are somewhere else”
John: “Fine but if he dies I'm blowing him up, okay?”
Cancer:”okay…”
John: “Have you met me yet?”*Nhoj spawns in*
Nhoj:”Hiya”
Cancer:”hi. Can you help with Y ryker?”*gestures at the convulsing child in Jaeger's arms*
Nhoj: “I Can try what's wrong with him?”
Cancer:”we don’t know.”
Nhoj: “Hm I'll look” *Shrinks and enters ryker’s ear*
Cancer:*watches, crouches down at a human size now*
Arson: * seems panicked by all the shouting.* 
Nhoj: *Comes out*“ I didn't see anything”
Cancer:”okay… Dream, you need to examine his mind.”*gives arson a torch*
John*Absorbs Nhoj*  “Good luck!”
Dream: * enters mind.* 
John: *Does the macarena on loop* “What? Its for ryker, obviously ”
Jaeger: *Raises Eyebrow and Continues to monitor vitals*
John: *Summons Nhoj* 
Nhoj: *Does the default dance* “For ryker”
Cancer:”okay… hey Jaeger, how are his vitals lookin’?”
Jaeger: “He is overheating, his heart rate is up and his breathing is ragged.” 
Cancer:”hmm. Mostly from the convulsing yes?”
John: “Nhoj Summon med kit”
Nhoj: “Okay” *He does that*
Arson: “ tiaw!!! maerD, em eveal t’nod!!” 
John: “What?”
Cancer:”he said ‘don’t leave me, Dream. Wait!!!’”
Jaeger: *Comforts Arson as much as he can*
Arson: * whimpers and hugs Jaeger.* 
John: *visible confusion*
Cancer:*group hugs with Arson and Jaeger, her scales are kinda pokey for Arson*
John: *joins for no reason whatsoever*
Nohj: “I know a doctor for ryker he is very good at what he does, he is in NewCago”
John: “OH YEAH! He is very good, should we try it?”
Nohj: “I don't know” *Looks to the group* “Should we?”
Arson: “ wonk t’nod I.” 
Cancer:”it’s better than nothing.”
Dream: “ so i’ve been reading his mind for nothing.” 
John: “ Well did you find anything?”
Jaeger: “Stop. Nobody leave the pocket dimension the mist is spreading as we speak going to the real world is suicide.”
John: “What do we do? I could try to summon him?”
Cancer:”there may be a doctor in the Inbetween. Go ahead, try and summon him, but if he has been possessed by the mist then this pocket dimension is no longer safe”
John: “I doubt he will be affected”
John and Nhoj: *Try to summon Dr.Hug fails*
John and Nhoj: *Try to summon Dr.Hug fails*
John and Nhoj: *Try to summon Dr.Hug Succeeds*
Dr. Hug: “What is going on, who are you? ”
Cancer:”we are some people who you are going to help us fix this child”*gestures at Y ryker*
John: “Dr. HUG! ”
Dr.hug: “Hi John, how's the scar?”
John: “Not bad, but can we focus on the child”
Dr.Hug:”Of course”*Turns to group* “What’s the symptoms”
Dr. Hug is infected.
Jake: “Alealer” *Blasts Dr. Hug away*
Dream: * lights Dr. hug on fire.*
A monitor comes on: 
News Caster: “Breaking news, the mist epidemic has morphed. It appears to be able to replicate any living thing. You need to be wary of all, you can tell if it is not the person, if ”
Evil Dr.hug: “HEHE”
Jaeger: *Blasts him apart with an energy blast he was charging since they had the idea of summoning him.*
John: *Heartbroken* “Dr Hug you were the best doctor ever, ” 
Marckx: “I…”
Dream: * grabs Arson in a hug.* “ you ok?”
Arson: * nods.* “ adnik.” 
The room begins to shake
News caster: “The federation has now located the source of this mist, it appears to have been started in lake michigan, they have now began project evacuation. If possible please leave this part of the universe.”
John: “Those darn Litterers ”
Y Ryker: *dying noises, though not dead*
John: “Ryker gag if you can hear me”
Cancer:*sarcastic*”lovely.” 
Tiktin: “I might be able, to help, the virus can not leave this Universe, for now, if we evacuate this universe, and all connected pocket dimensions, we should be good.”
Jaeger: “Dream, did you find anything in Y Ryker’s head?”
Dream: “ i-ii think.” 
Cancer:”anything? Anything at all?”
Note: Anyone interacting with Y Ryker is in Y Ryker’s pocket dimension (connected to SOUR)
John: “Should I go with dream and we can work together and we might find something?”
Dream: “ no i’ve got it.” * reenters Y Rykers mind.* 
Arson: “ on! maerD!!”  
Cancer:*walks over and hugs Arson*”you'll be okay. she ‘s coming back”
Arson: * whimpers.* “ wonk I. retsis ym tnaw tsuj I.” 
The 10 mage form a circle around Jake and begin to fade away with Jake.
John: “Jakes gone”
Jaeger: *Helps make Arson’s torch burn brighter and comforts him.”
John: *Summons lighter for arson*
Cancer:*makes a bonfire next to arson
John: *Summons flamethrower*
Arson: * smiles.* “ syug sknaht.” 
Y Ryker’s mind…..
Y Ryker: “DREAM! HELP!” 
A large shadow monster is attacking him
Dream: “ Ryker!” * attacks the shadow monster.* 
John: *Magically to dream*“what’s happening”
Dream: “ can’ttalknow!busy!”
 The shadow monster avoids the punches
Shadow Monster: *warped voice* “Leave.”
Dream: “ NO!” * attacks more.* 
The punches fail…passing through it.
Y Ryker: “Run. I’ve got this.” *he looks serious, and a bit sad* “This is why you don’t ignore voices in your head.”
Dream: “ I can’t  leave you here!” 
Y Ryker: “Go.” *he puts up mental barriers, forcing her out*
Outside Y ryker’s head
John: “I tried to communicate with dream, she found something”
Cancer:”okay… hopefully she can get rid of it.”
Arson: * nods.* 
John: “The wait is crazy, im sending Nhoj in, I will be able to keep tabs”*to Nhoj* “Go!”
Nhoj:*tries to Enter Y ryker’s mind*
Nhoj: *Leaves* “They’re gone i can't find them”
Dream: * stumbles out of mindscape.* “ owwww.” 
Cancer:”are you okay?”
John: *Absorbs Nhoj*“where were you dream?”
Dream: “ in Rykers mindscape.” 
John: “I couldn't find it”
Cancer:”are you okay? Is Y ryker okay?”
Dream: “ I don't know. How's Arson.” 
Arson “ enif.”
Dream: “ why are you still talking backwards.” 
Arson: “ wonk t’nod I. pots t’nac I” 
Y Ryker: *floats up, then vanishes*
Cancer:*attempts to track Y ryker’s link*
John:  *Realization * “Dr.Hugs is dead, he’s really dead”*pauses*“I need some time to process this” *Vanishes to his dimension*
You see a LARGE source of Y Ryker in one location, in another universe
Cancer:”woah, there is a LOT of Y ryker in another universe, nowhere else, I don’t know if that universe is infected though.”
A few moments later
John:*Appears* “I have spent the last year thinking about it now i'm over it”
Cancer:”okay. Well I’m going to send a probe to see if the universe that has all of the Y rykers is not infected”*sends gem fly probe to the Universe.*
John: “can i send Nhoj he doesn't need any food or anything”
Cancer:”Neither does a gem fly.”
John: “The only difference is i can summon him back at any time”
Cancer:”I can too. There isn’t really any difference i think. can you see through his eyes?”
John: “If I choose to”
Cancer:”okay so there isn’t really any difference. We should send both to get many angles and perspectives”*is monitoring the gem fly*
John: “Does your probe have powers?”
Cancer:”If I show powers to it. It has a very similar power set to mine”
John: “We should just be safe, i think we should send him”
Cancer:”I've already sent my fly. We can send both to be even more safe”
John: “Alright go Nhoj”
Nhoj: “Alright” *He goes*
Rain: “ where did Ryker go?” 
Cancer:”he is in a different universe right now. He should be coming back sometime.”
John: “Cancer sent a probe and Nhoj they will be back later”
Cancer:*nods in agreement*
John: “I just got a message from Nhoj” *Pauses* “He’s just checking in he thinks the probe is weird”
Cancer:”It is a gem fly, it is going to look weird. And just given it’s origins it is going to look alien”
John: “I just told him that”
Cancer:”cool”
Arson: “ dnatsrednu t’nod I” 
Cancer:”it’s a little bug that is I have made a gem. It comes from my planet so it looks more alien than an earth fly”
John: “In my world we had something similar but it was 7 feet tall”
Cancer:”cool bug”
The Y Ryker Universe?
The fly and Nhoj appear in a small room, Y Ryker appears to be sitting there, just fine.
Fly:*buzzes over to ryker*
Nohj:”Alright little fly let's do this”
Fly:*in tiny fly voice*”yeah!”
Nhoj: “Ryker! Are you alright?”
Fly:*lands on Y ryker’s nose*
Y Ryker?: “Who are you?” *swats fly*
Nhoj: “I am John's clone”
Fly:*buzzes over to his shoulder*
A megaphone turns on
Kyle: “Could you two leave us be? I’m doing some testing here.”
Nhoj:*to john* “We found him”
Fly:*Cancer is monitoring the fly*
Nhoj: “Come little fly lets not interfere”
Fly:”okay.”*lands on his shoulder*”But what if they are being mean to Y ryker? We can’t let them do that.”
Nhoj: *Whispers* “left my eyes here”
Fly:*in tiny fly voice*”okay. If they are being mean then we will know”
Nhoj: “Yes”
*Nhoj and Fly leave*
Back in the pocket dimension
John: *To arson and dream * They found him
Dream: “ ok. Thanks.”
Arson: “ uoy knaht.” 
Cancer:”yep, we have found him”
Rain: “ Is he ok?” 
Cancer:”he is uninjured”
Rain: * sighs in relief.* 
John: *Gasps loudly as he gains all the knowledge Nhoj received*
Arson: “ tahw.” 
Cancer::”what? Fly hasn’t had anything happen to her, so what’s wrong?”
Jaeger: “Where was he? Was anyone talking to him?”
Dream: “ Kyle.” 
John: “sorry i just received Nhoj, i gained all of the knowledge that he had”
Fly:*appears, lands on cancer’s horn*”Kyle was talking to him.”
Jaeger: “One sec” *Looks for Kyles number on his phone*
Fly:”Nhoj left his eye’s so we could see if they were being mean to Y ryker.”
Kyle calls Jaeger
Kyle: “I THOUGHT you’d leave me alone. I’m doing some important stuff right now.”
Jaeger: “Yes but Ryker just left and he apparently showed up there, also you might want to be careful we are dealing with a virus fallout currently.”*puts him on speaker phone?*
Kyle: *scoffs* “I’m fine, but that isn’t your Y Ryker. Tough luck, sorry.” *he doesn’t seem sincere*
John: *Fierce* “I was just there stop lying”
Fly:*nod’s as best as a fly can nod*
Kyle: “Let me repeat, not YOUR Y Ryker.”
Jaeger: “Do you have any idea where ours is?”
Kyle: “Yeah, I have a tracking device installed. But why should I tell you?”
Jaeger: “Good point but I could do a quick run for you to get anything.”
Arson: “ esaelp? Pleh rouy deen ew.”  
Kyle: “No.” *hangs up*
Jaeger: “Kay so the concentration of Y Rykers will prevent you from finding his location and Kyle won’t help because I keep bugging him. So he had that shadow monster in his head right?”
Dream: “ yup.” 
Cancer:”that pretty much sums it up. If I’m closer to where Ryker is I should be able to distinguish him from the other’s. There’s just too many too close together right now to find him without being much closer.”
Lyra: *appears, muttering to herself, looking around* “He…he…he’s gone right?”
Dream: “ yeah?”
Lyra: *sighs in relief* “Thank goodness.”
Rain: “ should I be concerned.” 
Lyra: *bites lip* “….No. everything’s fine…” *she seems quite nervous*
Dream: * laughs.* “ Well you are definitely lying.” 
Lyra: *worried* “No.”
Dream: * laughs again.* “ yup. Definitely lying.” 
Lyra: “It’s nothing.”
Dream: “ sure.” 
Lyra: *mumbles something like I blame Ryker*
Arson: “ yhw?” 
Lyra: “I could ask you the same question.”
Arson: “ naem uoy od tahw?”
Lyra: “It’s hard to understand you when you talk backwards.”
Arson: * cheeks turn red in embarrassment.* “ ti pleh t’nac I.” 
Lyra: “Oh well. I’m going to go… I have…work….to do. Yeah work.”
Dream: “ what kind of work? Where are you going? Why are you keeping secrets?”
Lyra: *blinks and looks straight at her* “I have no idea what you’re talking about.” 
Dream: “ sure you do. So answer my questions.” 
Lyra: “I’m part of a book club alright! And I’m not keeping any secrets.”
Dream: “ ok. That’s all I needed to hear.” 
Lyra: *sighs in annoyance* “Thank you!” *teleports away*
Dream: * giggles.* “ I love pushing people's buttons.” 
Arson: * still embarrassed. Does Not answer.* 
Hestuia: *chuckling in a corner*
Dream: “ what?” 
Hestuia: “Oh Nothing. Dramatic Irony.”
Dream: “ What's ironic?” 
Hestuia: “Never mind.”
Dream: “ Well you brought it up so now you have to tell me.” 
Hestuia: “I know something that you don’t.”
Dream: “ what do you know?” 
Hestuia: “What’s going on with Lyra and Y Ryker.”
Dream: “ sooo there doing a book club thing together?” 
Hestuia: *chuckles* “You could think that.”
Dream: “ oh so she was lying.” 
Hestuia: “Doesn’t take a Future Teller to figure that out.”
Dream: “ I kinda figured she was. She wouldn’t act like that for a book club.” 
Hestuia: *continues laughing*
Dream: “ What's so funny now?” 
Hestuia: “You all being oblivious.”
Dream; “ ok.” 
Arson: * mumbles something.* 
The Librabraribry
Librarian: *reading a book* “Oh hey Lyra. Same spot?”
Lyra: *nervous* “Yep.” 
Librarian: *opens a small portal to her left* “Go ahead.”
Lyra: “Thanks.” *walks through to private library section*
Rae: * appears in the library.* “ ow. How long were we gone?”
William: * appears after her.* “ I have no idea.”
Librarian: “Let me guess. You’re here to talk to Lyra. Here.” *reopens the portal*
Rae: “ no?” * look around.* “ oh I’m sorry. We didn’t mean to appear here.” 
Librarian: *sighs* “It’s all right. But now I feel another younger presence of you around. I have a feeling you know something about it. You may leave now.”
Rae: “ of course. So sorry for bothering you. Come on William.” * walks out of library.*
William: * follows.* “ Where do we go now?”
Rae: “ off to find the others.” 
Meanwhile, in an undisclosed location
A warped heart the size of a car is beating in the middle of a large room which appears to be decayed and overgrown. Two archeologists arrive on the scene
Archeologist 1: *startled* “What is that!”
Arc 2: “That looks like…a heart.”
Arc 1: “That’s because…it is.”
Arc 2: *panicking* “We should go. We shouldn’t have even explored the ruins in the first place.”
Arc 1: “Let’s go. No artifact is worth going in there.”
Arc 2: “We should probably still take a couple of photos for the newspapers. We may have just discovered the largest organism in the world.”
Arc 1: *nervous* “All right. But be careful. We don’t want to disturb whatever it is.”
Arc 2: “Of course not.” *He slowly walks into the room, paying attention to every detail, snapping photos.*
Arc 1: *nervous standing by the door.*
Arc 2: *paying close attention to some artifact, not looking at Arc 1*
Arc 1: *gagged and dragged away by some form of tendril*
Arc 2: “Hey! This looks like it’s more ancient than we thought! These are some old artifacts.” *waits for response* “Hey? Are you there?” *turns around and sees that Arc 1 is gone* “Hello?” *he gets dragged by some tendrils, away into some form of hole at the end of the room, screaming*
Meanwhile
Dream: “ Well that was disturbing.”
Arson: “ tahw?”
Dream: “ Oh nothing.”
Arson: “ em llet!” 
Dream: “ no.” 
Xin: “ I don't speak duchlandish”
Arson: “ hsidnalhcud ton s’ti. sdrawkcab s’ti .”
Hestuia: “Ancay ouyay igpay atinlay eakspay?”
Xin: “ hey lorax where did you come from”
Hestuia: *sighs* “Eventually you’ll all regret calling me that.”
Xin: “ yeash”
Xin: “ touchy subject. And if we're talking in different languages then”
Xin: “♒︎♓︎”
Arson: “ olleh.” 
Dream: ⬥︎♒︎♋︎⧫︎⬧︎ ♓︎⧫︎ ⬥︎♓︎⧫︎♒︎ ⍓︎□︎◆︎ ♋︎■︎♎︎ ⬥︎♓︎■︎♑︎♎︎♓︎■︎♑︎⬧︎?” 
The Author: “We’re done here. Or I’ll burn your house down. With the lemons.” The Editor: “I don’t wantyour dang lemons!”
Dream: “ ⬥︎♒︎♋︎⧫︎ ♒︎□︎◆︎⬧︎♏︎?””
Xin: “sounds good”
John: “What did i just experience” *Shakes head*
Arson: “ noitaservnoc a.” 
Xin: “ you must be new here”
Dream: “ yeah. This is one of our more normal conversations.” 
Rain: * mumbles something about too many languages.* 
Cancer:”I speak many languages.”
Rain: “ I only speak 3. And wingdings is not one of them.” 
Cancer:”I might be able to help learn them. They are just symbols replacing letters and symbols”
Rain: “ uhhhhhhhh that doesn't help. I figured that much.” 
John: “Im good with plain ol’ english”
Cancer:”well then I can’t do much for ya. I could tell you which symbols correspond to which letters though”
Rain: “ thank you but no thank you. I'd prefer to learn it on my own.” 
Cancer:”okay.”
Arson: “ won od ew od tahw ooooooooos?” 
Cancer:”We wait, I don't know. Maybe somebody knows something, i don’t know”                                                                        
Xin: “ I just got here”
Dream: “ uhhh. Maybe?” 
Arson: “ wonk uoy od tahw?!!!!” 
Cancer:”yeah, what do you know?”
Dream: * lying.* “ nothing.” 
Arson: “ reil!!!!” 
Xin: “ I think I will have to remove arsons lerings unless he begins to speak normally”
Arson: * looks frustrated.*“ gniyrt m’i!!!” 
Cancer:”yeah, he’s kinda stuck and we don’t know why, so if you can fix him, go right ahead”
Dream: “ I don’t see anything wrong with speaking backwards. I can understand it just fine.” 
Rain: “ I don't know what he’s saying.” 
Cancer:”I don’t think that there is anything wrong, it's just difficult to understand at times”
Dream: “ your point?” 
Xin: “ he should just speak normal”
Arson: “ t’nac I!” 
Cancer:”well he can’t right now so you can deal”
Dream: * pauses.* “ wait. What's a lerings?” 
Cancer:”yeah, what is that?”
Xin: “learnings are another term for vocal cords”
Cancer:”okay.”
Xin: “ if could teach him sign language so I can understand him or I could kill wich one”
Dream: “ uhhh don’t kill him. I don’t know if you can kill him. Also you don’t understand backwards?” 
Xin: “ I do but I can't be bothered to translate”
Arson: “ ton yhw?” 
Cancer:”well then you don’t get to kill him because your lazy and won’t bother to translate”
Xin: “ why not just talk backward reversing the reverse”
Arson: “ woh gniwonk tuothiw sdrawkcab gniklat ekil staht.” 
Xin: “ even translate that doesn't make any sense
Dream: “ yeah it does.” 
Xin: “learn how than”
Dream: “ learn how to what?” 
John: “Read it backwards”
Dream: “ I already know how to do that.” 
Cancer:”me too. You just learn”
Arson: “ haey.” 
Nhoj: “What are we doing now?”
Dream: “ I don't know.” 
Arson: “ maerD fo tuo noitamrofmi yrp ot gniyrt erew.” 
Xin: “ use your words”
Arson: “ ma I!!!” 
Cancer:”and we should continue to try to pry information from Dream”
Dream: “ what would I know?” 
Cancer:”where Lyra is”
Dream: * lying.* “ I don't know.” 
Cancer:”you know. You know about just about everything.”
Dream: “ not everything.” 
Cancer:”close enough”
Dream: “ still. Bold of you to assume I know anything.” 
Rae: * appears with William, takes one look at the group.* “ Jaeger! What did you do?!” 
Jaeger: “Arson is just talking backwards and Ryker left before I could do anything.”
Dream: “ He left us alone several times.”
Rae: “ you had one job Jaeger! Look after the kids and don't let them break anything!!! Also I didn'tI didn't know about what happened to Arson.” 
Jaeger: “Excuse me but my shift ended hours ago!”
Rae: “ That's not how it works! This is why you're not getting paid!” 
Arson: “ diap gintteg saw eh?” 
Jaeger: “I don’t even need money!”
Rae: * sighs.* “ What is Arson saying?”
Rain:* whispers to Dream.* “ is-is that me?”
Dream: “ yup.” 
Rae: “ Jaeger, how on earth did they bring Rain here?” 
Jaeger: “Find Y Ryker and interrogate him.”
Rae: * sighs.* “ oh my…” 
William: “ Well what do we do?” 
Jaeger: “We are trying to find Y Ryker, I called Kyle and he wouldn’t give us help so we are trying to find him because he also has a shadow beast in his head according to Dream.”
Cancer:”mhm. I can’t track him because of the Y ryker concentration that Kyle has until I am much closer to Y ryker.”
Rae: “ Well, does anyone have any information?” 
Dream: “ nope.”
Arson: “ seod maerD!!” 
Rae: “ what?” 
Dream: “ he said no.”
Arson: * glares at Dream.* “ ffuts gnidih pots!!!!!”
Dream: “ I'm not hiding anything.” 
John: “What are you hiding”
Dream: “ nothing.” 
John: *Summons lie detector* “Prove it”
Dream: “ prove what?” 
John: “That you are not hiding anything”
Dream: ‘ why would I hide anything from you?” 
John: “Because I don't know you fully yet?”
Dream: “ why is it that whenever there's some information the group doesn't have they all assume I know something?” 
John: “I expect nothing from anyone”
Dream; “Then why are you trying to make me prove I’m innocent?” 
John: “Everyone thinks your hiding something, but if the detector says no they should back off”
Dream; “ yeah guys.”
Arson: “ gnihtemos wenk uoy taht pu thguorb uoy!!!!!”
John: “Do you want to try it” *Points to  lie detector*
Dream: “ Try what?” 
John: *Uses a truth spell* “Are you hiding anything”
Dream: “ Why would I hide anything?” 
John: “Why would you hide something”
Dream: “ you tell me.” 
John: “Arson you know dream better than anybody you try”
Arson: “ gniedih uoy era tahw?”
Dream: “ sorry. I can’t understand you when you talk backwards.” * giggles.*
Arson: * looks frustrated and mad.* “ tluciffid gnieb uoy era yhw?!” 
Dream: “ because it's funny.” 
Arson: * sighs.* “ esu on s’ereht. Su llet ot gniog ton s’ehs ”  
Dream: “ yup.” 
John: “Alright then ” 
Rae: “ Dream  please. We need your help so can you just tell us what you know.”
Dream: * sighs.* “ fine. Lyra is at the Library. And there are two archaeologists that got attacked by something.” 
Rae: “ how do you know the stuff about the archaeologists is important?”
Dream: “ I wouldn’t know about it if it wasn’t.” 
William: “ I have a question. Last I was aware we were being hunted down by Wiziker. And now there are more people here and some people are missing so what the heck happened?” 
Dream: “ Well there's a smoke being roaming around the multiverse now.” 
Rae: “ what?!” 
Rain: “ and then some more people got into a huge battle.”
Dream: “ yeah.”
Rae: * groans.* “ We were gone for way too long.” 
John: “Yeah, Im john and this is Nhoj”
Nhoj: “hiya”
William: “ uhh hello John and Hnoj.” 
Hestuia: “Ah, good ol’ dramatic irony.”
John: “Yes”
Hestuia: “So, you guys gonna go to the archaeologists or Lyra?”
Dream: “I don't know.”
Arson: “ ni erif tghil I nac eno hciw?” 
Hestuia: “I mean, it would probably be better lighting fires in an old dangerous temple than a library.”
Jaeger: “No lighting fires in the temple or the library, if you want to light fires go somewhere else.”
Nhoj: “Can I blow up  mya school, pleease?”
John: “Yeah that sounds like fun can weeeee?”
Jaeger: “I have no control over you but I would not recommend it.” 
Arson: “ serif gnitghil m’I! em pots t’nac uoy!” 
Rae: “ Arson. No.”
Hestuia: *writing stuff in sheets of paper* “Let him. It doesn’t matter.”
Rae: “ no! That’s a terrible idea!” 
Hestuia: *looks up at her* “I know what I’m talking about. Just let him go.”
Rae: “ I don’t know.”
Hestuia: “Look at me. I know what I’m talking about. He’ll be fine.”
Rae: “ I know. I’m more worried about the consequences of the fire.” 
Hestuia: “Fire won’t affect it. Don’t worry about it.”
Dream: “ don’t worry about it. You know we won’t listen to Rae and light fires anyway.” 
Hestuia: “Go right ahead.” *he looks at them* “Whenever you’re ready just continue walking in that direction.”
Cancer:”I’m more worried about them getting infected by the mist than the effect of the fire”
Dream: “ we won’t get infected.”
Arson: * begins to walk forward and then trips. Gets up.* “ owww.”
Dream: “ Are you ok?”
Arson: * nods.* “ yeah but that really hurt.” 
Cancer:”yaaaaayyyyyyyyyy!!! You're not talking backwards anymore!”
Arson: “ oh yeah. Yay!”
Dream: “ sdrawkcab gniklat htiw gnorw s‘tahw?”
Cancer:*sighs*”nothing, It’s just harder to understand is all”
Dream: “ eh, agree to disagree.” 
Cancer:”okay.”
Rae: * sighs.* “ ok where are we going? Temple or to see Lyra?” 
Dream: *shrugs.* “ I don't care.”
Cancer:”temple, I want to see the dead archeologists”
Rae: “ ok. One vote for the temple. What about the rest of you? Dream you have to vote.” 
Dream: “ why?”
Arson: “ Well I'm not allowed to set stuff on fire at the library so the temple.” 
Cancer:”I don’t even think that we are allowed inside the library at all, unless the librarian changed that”*gives Rae stink eye*
Rae: “ what did i do?” 
Cancer:”nothing.”*stops*
Rae: “ Then why were you giving me that look?” 
Cancer:”because. To the Temple!”
Rae: * sighs.* 
Rain: “ I'd rather go to the library.” 
Cancer:”you're allowed in so you can go. I don’t mind. The librarian can watch you. Or Lyra”
Rae: “ What about the rest of the group?” 
Cancer:”Dream still hasn’t voted yet”
Dream: “ I refuse to vote.” 
Cancer:”then I vote for you and I choose to go to the temple”
Dream: “ NO!!! You can’t vote for me!” 
Rae: “ yeah you can’t.”
Cancer:”then vote Dream if you don’t want someone else doing it for you.”
Dream: “ No. You're not allowed to vote for me and I'm not voting.” 
Cancer:”then you don’t get a say in where we are going”
Dream: “ok.” 
Hestuia: “You could split up into two groups.”
Jaeger: “I am going to go to the heart regardless, Rae I think that you should go to the library.”
Hestuia: *nods* “I’m going to the library as well.”
Jaeger: “Great, who wants to come to the Heart? If you come with me you will not be able to destroy or burn anything unless the situation calls for it.”
Rae: “ I’m fine with going to the library.”
Dream: “ I’ll go to the heart.”
Arson: “ me too.”
Cancer:”me too.”
Ryker: *appears* “Oh hey! Sorry I was busy turning off attack functions for Wiziker. What’s going on?” *looks at Hestuia* “Oh okay. Right. I’ll go with the Heart people.” *opens two different portals* “The left one is the Heart place, the right is the Library.”
Dream: “ ok, come on Jaeger!”
Hestuia: *walks through Library portal* “Come on Rae and Rain. Let’s go. Anyone else coming?”
Rae: * goes through portal.*
Rain: * follows.*
Hestuia: “Is anyone else coming? Like William or something?”
Willam: * shrugs.* “ sure.” * goes through portal.* 
The libairairbiarbay
Librarian: “Oh. You again.” *sighs* “What do you want?”
Rain: “ Can I get a book?” 
Librarian: *smiles at her* “Sure! What’s your name honey?”
Rain: “ I’m Rain.” 
Librarian: *slightly startled, gives a look at Rae* “All right Rain. What book are you looking for?”
Rain: “ Do you have any on monsters?” 
Librarian: “Plenty. Anything specific?”
Rain: “ no. Just one monsters.” 
Librarian: *hands her a smaller encyclopedia on monsters* “This work?”
Rain: “ Yes, thank you.” * takes book.*
Librarian: “Of course! Anything else?”
Rain: “ this will do for now. But thank you for offering it.” 
Librarian: “Is there a reason the rest of you are here?”
Rae: * shrugs.* “ Well we were going to see Lyra...”  
Librarian: *pulls up portal* “Is she expecting you?”
Rae: “ no not really. We just have a question for her.” 
Librarian: “Let me notify her real quick.” *does so* “All right, go Right in.”
Rae: * enters the portal.* “ Lyra?” 
Lyra: *slightly distracted and disheveled* “Oh hi Rae. What’s up?”
Rae: “ Hey Lyra. Do you know where Y Ryker is?” 
Lyra: *quickly* “No.”
Rae:* seems worried.*“ Are you sure?” 
Lyra: “Yep.Don’tknowwhereRykerisisthatall?”
Rae: * sighs.* “ I think so.” 
Hestuia: *gives Lyra a look* “All right. Tell them Lyra.”
Lyra: “Tell them what?” *she seems in a rush to make you leave*
Rae: * sighs.* “ Look Lyra. It’s important that we know where he is. If you know anything, we need you to tell us.” 
Lyra: *implying something* “I don’t know WHERE he is.”
Rae: “ Well, do you know anything?” 
Lyra: *looks around, almost nods and swiftly shakes her head no.*
Rae: “ please Lyra. We need to find him.”
Lyra: *face calms, in a flat demeanor* “I don’t know anything about Y Ryker.”
Rae: * looks suspiciously at her.* “ …ok.” * begins to leave.*
Hestuia: *Looks at her sympathetically* “I’m sorry Lyra.” *he begins to walk out as well* 
Rain: * had stayed behind to read.* “ Did you find anything?”
Rae: “ unfortunately no.”
Rain: “ what do we do know?”
Rae: “ Just wait here until the others finish their quest I guess.”
Rain: “ ok.” * continue to read.* 
Hestuia: “Three, two and on-“ 
A large blast can be held faintly, and an orange flash is visible
Rae: “ what was that?!”
Hestuia: “And..”
Librarian: *almost swears* “That’s Lyra’s study.” *looks at group* “What did you do!”
Rae: “ nothing. We just talked to her.” 
Librarian: “Well now a chunk of my books are destroyed. Go fix this.” *reopens portal to Lyra’s study*
Rae: * rushes in.* 
Hestuia: *walks in, strolling*
Lyra: *blasting away at books, with light beams, starting small fires*
Rae: “ Lyra! Stop!” * starts putting out fires and tries to stop Lyra.* 
Lyra: *ignores Rae, and continues lighting fires, tears streaming down her eyes*
Rae: “ LYRA!!” * tries to stop her.*
Lyra: *blasts Rae with a ray of shadows, disorienting and blinding her, continues burning books*
Rae: * stubbles still trying to stop her.* “ Hestuia! Can I get some help please?!” 
Hestuia: *clears throat* “I’m afraid not my friend.”
Lyra: *annoyed at Rae, steals her shadow, and Rae suddenly becomes rigid, unable to move*
Rae: * falls over.* “ Hestuia!” 
Hestuia: “I’m sorry Rae. I have to.” *sits down on the floor, and teleports Rain into the room* “Go help.”
Rain: “ how?!” * looks around panicked.*
Hestuia: “You’ll figure it out.”
Lyra: *pulls Rae down into a portal of shadows, slowly including her*
Rain: * runs and grabs Rae trying to pull her out.*
She’s getting dragged in too
Lyra: *voice warped* “Surrender.” 
Rain: “ no!” * attempts to use her powers to help her.* 
The shadows latch onto her, and they start getting pulled in faster
Hestuia: “Goodbye! See you in a little while you two! I’m sorry.” *vanishes*
Rain: “ Hestuia!” * struggles more.* 
They are pulled through, and black out, then, sometime later, wake up in a black, empty void. Lyra muttering to herself can be heard, but not from any describable location
Rae: “ we-were are we?” 
???: “I call it The Cloak, but you may think of it as Lyra’s subconscious.”
Rain: “ Who are you?” 
???: “You don’t know me, but I bet Rae does.”
Rae: “ Are you- crazy Ryker?” 
???: “I rather hate that name.”
Rae: “ I apologize.” 
Rain: * grabs Rae.* “ What are we doing here?” 
???: “Oh, I’m just holding you here until I can put you in my new body.”
Rae: “ What?!” * panics.* 
???: “My new body needs a lot of energy. Those archeologists were just not enough.”
Rain: “ we’re going to die?!” 
???: “You could call it death, or, just think of it as repurposement.”
Rain: “ No! Let us go!” 
???: *scoffs* “Why would I do that?” *he slowly begins chuckling* “And you all made it sooo EASY!”
Rain: * whimpers.* 
???: “Don’t worry about it. It’ll all be over soon.” *chuckling*
Rain: * hyperventilating.* “ there’s got to be a way out! Theresgottobeawayout!!” 
???: “Well yes, there is. But good luck finding it.”
Rain: * tries to use her powers.* 
Fails
???: “You’re in MY mindscape.” *he unhinges his jaw* “Hold on one second.”
Rain: * looks around for anything she can use.* 
Lyra is sobbing in a corner somewhere, but it seems pretty hopeless
???: *opens mouth, and eats Rae and Rain, warping Reality, and suddenly, they’re somewhere else* “Welcome to my new mindscape! It’s nice right?”
It looks like an intense burning forest. There’s some whimpering in a corner
Rae: “ Come on.” * gets up and walks towards the whimpering.*
Rain: * follows.* 
Y Ryker: *whimpering*
Rain: “ Ryker!”
Rae: * sighs in relief.* 
Y Ryker: *keeps shooting fires at the trees, mumbling* “He can’t find me if I keep lighting fires. I’m in charge. As long as I light fires I’m in charge.”
Rain: “ Ryker?” 
Y Ryker: *shaking back and forth, continuing to repeat the mumbling*
Rain: * shakes him.* “ Ryker!!” 
???: “He can’t hear you or see you. He’s too focused on ignoring everything that he doesn’t even realize I’m in control.” *chuckles*
Rain: “ you monster! Let go of my brother!!” 
???: *scoffs* “Brother? you aren’t even related! If anything, he’s your father.”
Rain: * mutters something.* “ Let him go!”
???: “I’m not doing anything. This is all him. I just spooked him a bit.”
Rain: * breathes heavily.* 
???: “Whatcha goina do? Smack me? Oh boy. I’m so scared.” *sarcastic*
Rain: * continues.* 
???: *laughing* “Let’s start draining your energy.” *their energy slowly seems to leak out, making them more tired*
Rae: * breathes deeply trying to hold on to her energy.* Someone please. Help us. 
Heart Gang
Ryker: *checks watch* “All right. Let’s go guys.” *walks through portal*
Jaeger: “Alright no burning things until we know what they are.” *Heads through portal.”
Dream: * giggles.* “ ok .” * heads through portal.*
Arson: * follows.* 
Cancer:*follows*
Dream: * immediately starts lighting fires.*
Arson: * joins in.* “ waaaahoooooo.” 
The heart is beating audibly. Ruins can be seen around the room with warped vines everywhere. A figure can be seen within the heart, motionless
Jaeger: *Puts out fires* “Stop. if you wanted to light things on fire you should not have come with us.”
Dream: “ we’re lighting fires! You can’t stop us!” * lights more fire.*
Arson: * lights fire as well.* 
A faint screaming noise can be heard from inside the heart
Jaeger: *Prevents them from lighting anymore fires* “Be quiet! We don’t even know what that thing is!”
Dream: “ No!” * lights more fire.* 
The vines seem to hear the noise, and go toward Dream
Dream: * teleports to another location in the room.* 
Jaeger: *Removes the air to prevent the sound waves from traveling*
Dream: * teleports back over to Arson.* 
At this point, you all notice the corpses of Rae, Rain, and two archeologists hanging near the heart, lifeless.
Jaeger: “Crud.” *Attempts to retrieve corpses to inspect the damage via air manipulation and hovering them* 
As you attempt to take them, the vines seem to grip on tighter, not letting go
Jaeger: *Squints in frustration looks for the source of the vines*
It’s the heart.
Jaeger: *Inspects the heart for any kind of weapon other than the vines or potential weak spots.*
Dream: “ Can I set it on fire?” 
Jaeger: “That is a very real possibility that it might work but it might just get mad and try to grab all of us”
Arson: “ awww please?” 
Jaeger: “How about we have Ryker poke it, if he is so powerful?”
Dream: “ where is he?” 
Jaeger: “Didn’t he come here with us?”
Ryker: *smiles* “I did.”
Dream: “ soooo can you poke it?”
Ryker: “No.”
Arson: “ why not?”
Ryker: “I’m not touching that.”
Dream: “ why?” 
Ryker: “It’s a Heart.” *face wrinkles in disgust* “Slimy and disgusting.”
Dream: “ So you're squeamish?” 
Ryker: “No.”
Dream: “ the touch it.” 
Ryker: “No. I dare you to touch it.”
Dream: “ I triple dog dare you to touch it.” 
Ryker: “I QUADRUPLE dog dare YOU!”
Dream: “ on one condition.” 
Ryker: “What?”
Dream: “ you have to make sure I don’t die and I don’t get captured.”
Ryker: “I mean I’ll try. I’m not touching any of those vines or the heart though.”
Dream: “ why?” 
Ryker: *shakes head* “I don’t touch things. Germs.”
Dream: “ ahhh you're a germaphobe.” * sighs.* “ alright.” * teleports in front of the heart, lights it on fire, then teleports away.* 
I mean, it’s a heart. That’s pretty much ALL weakness.
The heart begins burning, and unearthly screeching can be heard inside. 
Y Ryker: *from inside heart* “Stop! Ow! You’re killing me!” *unearthly scream* “Why!?” *sobbing* “Dream!”
Dream: * waves hand and the fire goes out.* “ sorry.” 
The heart pulses. Vines slowly begin to move toward the group
Meanwhile in Y Rykers head
???: *scoffs* “Your friends are idiots for coming here! Now I can FEAST!” *he chuckles evilly* “And you two. You’ll be a good first course.” *begins to drain them more intensely*
Y Ryker: *whimpering and crying in a corner.*
Rae: * continues to try and contain her energy.* 
The heart
Ryker: “All right you guys. All ya have to do is get Ryker out of the heart. Without hurting him. That shouldn’t be too hard right?” *he floats away from a few vines reaching toward him* “No.” 
Jaeger: “Does anyone have any ideas on how to get him out safely?”
Ryker: *shrugs* “Oh also, Rae and Rain are in Y Rykers head right now. Slowly dying because of Crazy Ryker.”
Jaeger: “Dang it! Unless anyone happens to have a scalpel there isn’t really going to be a safe way to do this.” *Starts Torching the vines with Energy blasts*
The vines shrivel up and burn, but another, thicker and different colored vine latches onto Arson and begins dragging him closer to the heart.
Arson: “ NO!” * just passes through the vines.* 
Jaeger: *Turns the vines into steel so they cannot move*
The vines just simply avoid the blasts. 
Dream: “ Now can I light something on fire?”* teleports over to the heart and attempts to cut it open with a knife.* 
The Steel transfusion powers work like an Area of Effect, they are not blasts, yeah still
The heart is cut open, and the heart starts bleeding. Y Ryker falls out of the heart
Dream: “ di-did i do it?” 
As you look at Y Ryker, he looks…different. He’s got a hoodie like Arson’s, yellow-red eyes, and strawberry blonde hair. See here. All energy saving halts and everyone is woken up. Mist leaks from Y Ryker’s mouth, floating away.
Rae: * gasps.* 
Rain: * looks over.* “ Ryker?” 
Cancer:*walks over by Jaeger, is unsure, watchfull*
Arson: “ Ryker, are you ok?” 
Y Ryker: *lying on the floor, whimpering* “I…can’t…walk.”
Dream: “ Did I do something wrong?” 
Y Ryker: “No. You did the best you could.”
Arson: “ Is there anything we can do?” 
Y Ryker: “I…can’t hear the buzzing.”
Dream: “ That's not a good sign.” 
Y Ryker: “It is not.” *just lying on the ground*
Cancer:*watches, floats over and attempts to heal Y ryker*
Rain: “ Do you need help up?” 
Y Ryker: “Yes…”
Arson: * grabs his arms and attempts to put him at least to a sitting position.*
He sits down.
Dream: “ Can you use your powers?” 
Y Ryker: “If i Could, I would be able to walk.”
Dream: “ Well that’s really not good.” 
Y Ryker: *shrugs* “It really isn’t.”
Hestuia: *appears* “You should shake hands with him Dream.”
Dream: * looks at Hestuia, holds out hand and it lights on blue fire.* “ why?” 
Hestuia: “Do you not trust me?”
Y Ryker: “I sure don’t. You tricked Rae and Rain. Wait. How did I know that?”
Rain: * shrugs.* 
Dream: “ Well it’s your decision Ryker. It’s your choice whether or not you want to shake my hand.”
Y Ryker: *bites lip* “Fine.” *shakes Dreams hand* 
A slight tingle goes from Dream to Y Ryker
Dream: * flinches.* “ What was that?” 
Hestuia: “You just agreed for Ryker to use your powers. Congrats. You’re linked.”
Dream: “ linked? So if he dies will I die?” 
Hestuia: *nods* “And Vice versa.”
Dream: “ uhhh ok?” 
Y Ryker: *stands up* “Um…sorry?”
Dream: “ na. It’s fine. Now you can light stuff on fire like me and Arson.” 
Y Ryker: *turns to Rain* “Um…could I?”
Rain: * holds hand out.* “ sure.”
Y Ryker: *shakes hands, smiling*
Same tingle.
Rae: “ soooo what happens now?” 
Y Ryker: *shrugs*
Dream: “ We could play a game.”
Y Ryker: “Sure! What game? Also where are we?” *looks around temple*
Arson: “ Well this is where we found you.” 
Rain: “ Let's play Uno!” 
Ryker: *quickly* “Let’s do it at SOUR instead.” *opens portal*
Dream: “ why?” 
Ryker: “Because it’s dangerous here.” 
Dream: “ since when have you been responsible for us?” * starts to walk through portal anyway.*
Arson: * follows.*
Rain: * walked through when Ryker told her too.* 
Ryker: “Thank you!” *goes through*
Y Ryker: *walks slightly awkwardly through portal*
Rae. “ Do you need help?” 
Y Ryker: “No…”
SOUR
Ryker: *summons Uno table* “All right. Go ahead.”
Dream: “ you didn’t answer my question.” 
Ryker: “Since I realized I’m related to, like, all of you.” *pauses* “I also don’t want Ryker to die.”
Dream: “ ohhh.” * sits down to start the game.* 
Arson: “ Does anyone have cards?”
Rae: “ I do.” * hands them to Arson.* “ don’t you dare burn any of them.”
Y Ryker: *chuckles, and sits down*
Arson: * sighs. Starts dealing cards.* 
Cancer:*appears, watches them play uno*
Y Ryker: “UNO!”
Arson: * makes Y Ryker draw 24.* 
Y Ryker: *plays another draw 24 on Dream*
Dream: * plays another drawl 24 on top of that so she doesn't have to drawl.* 
Rain: * plays a draw 100 instead so they must draw 172 cards.* 
Arson: * plays a draw 2.* 
Ryker: “What kinda UNO game is this?”
Dream: “ the best kind. Now Ryker you don’t have a drawl card to play. Draw 174 cards.” 
Y Ryker: “No! I won because I used all my cards.”
Dream: “ yeah so now you have to draw because you don’t have any cards.” 
Y Ryker: “This isn’t any kind of uno I know!”
Arson: “ Basically you don’t win by using all your cards.” 
Y Ryker: “Well how DO you win?”
Rain: * shrugs.*
Dream: “ you have to get only 7 of the same color.” 
Y Ryker: “Let me guess. You just won.”
Dream: “ I’m close.” 
Y Ryker: *gets up and leaves*
Dream: * plays a 2 card, then lays down 7 green cards.* “ Now I win.” 
Arson: “ Do you want to play something else?” 
Y Ryker: “Let’s go loot the ruins!”
Dream: “ yeah!”
Arson: “ yes!”
Rain: “ maybe we shouldn’t.”
Y Ryker: “Are you scaaaaared?”
Rain: “ no. I just don’t think that that’s very smart.”
Dream: * gets up to begin the looting.* 
Y Ryker: *making chicken noises*
Arson: * giggles and gets up.* 
Rain: “ I'M NOT SCARED!!” 
Cancer:”I know, you're sensible, and aren’t trying to raise the chances of you all dying to crazy Ryker.”
Y Ryker: *still clucking like a chicken*
Dream: “ Come on Rain. It will be fun.”
Rain: * glances over at the adults.*
Rae: * is working on stuff in her backpack.*
Rain: “ shouldn’t we ask someone first?” 
Cancer:”you don't have to according to me. You can be more outgoing and you don’t have to listen to the adults.”
Y Ryker: “Are you afraaaaaaaid of going without an adult?” *taunts her*
Rain: “ no.”
Dream: *teasing.* “ Are you Sure?”
Arson: “ guys. Let’s go.”
Rain: “ fiiiine.” * starts walking.*
Cancer:*turns into a child and follows*
They wander around to a small room with a treasure chest
Dream: “ treasure!”
Rain: “ it might be a mimic. Just a warning. It could be trapped.” 
Y Ryker: “TREASURE!” *runs up to treasure chest and opens it*
A dart hits Y Ryker straight in the head, and he falls to the floor
Rain: “ told ya so.”  
Y Ryker: *gets up and rubs head* “Ow.”
Arson: “ what was in that dart?” 
Y Ryker: *shrugs*
Cancer:*waddles over in her armor, opens chest, and begins eating the treasure*
The treasure is eyeballs of Ryker’s enemies
Rain: * takes the dart.* 
Y Ryker: “Hey! We don’t know what that does!”
Rain: * examines the dart to see what was in it.* 
Some sort of blue liquid.
Rain: “ we need to figure out what this stuff is.” 
Y Ryker: “I dunno. You figure it out. You’re smarter than me, even though I act smart in order to feel superior.”
Rain: “ uhhh ok? We should probably ask Ryker. It’s his place.” 
Y Ryker: “I don’t like Ryker.”
Jaeger: *Jokingly* “Why don’t we ask Kyle?”
Y Ryker: “That's a good idea!”
Dream: “ That's a good idea.”
Arson: “ Are you babysitting us again?” 
Y Ryker: *calls Kyle on Jaegers phone and puts it on speakerphone*
Dream: * laughs.* 
Ring.
Kyle: *on phone, gagging* “Ghah!”
He can hear Cancer munching on eyes in the background
Dream: “ Are you ok Kyle?” 
Kyle: *clear throat* “Yeah! Of course! You wanted to ask me something?” 
Rain: “ we need to know what this blue stuff is.” 
Kyle: “We’ll the only blue liquid Ryker uses is truth serum. That all?”
Rain: “ I think so.”
Kyle: “Great! Nice talking to all of you! Bye!”
Dream: “ Well it looks like you’ll  have to tell the truth now.”
Y Ryker: “Oh no.”
Rain: “ what?” 
Y Ryker: “I have many secrets that I don’t want to reveal.”
Dream: “ What are your secrets?” 
Y Ryker: “Um…I’d prefer not to say."
John: "Tell me"
Arson: “ Tell us!” 
Y Ryker: “No.”
Dream: “ What are your secrets?” 
Y Ryker: “Yes.”
Rain: “ That's not an answer.” 
Y Ryker: “That is a false statement.”
Dream: “ yeah yes is the answer to many questions.”
Arson: “ Let's bug Jaeger!” * sets Jaeger on fire.* 
Dream: “ yeah!” 
Jaeger: *Unfazed, continues drinking tea.*
Y Ryker: *subtly pours blue liquid in drink*
Jaeger: *Throws away tea and makes more*
Dream: * knock Tea out of hand.* 
Jaeger: *Actually a little mad at the loss of tea*
Y Ryker: *throws crumpets at Jaeger*
Dream: * laughs.* “ because it’s just hot leaf water.” 
Arson: “ what?”
Dream: “ Eve’s mad at me about the tea.” * begins burning tea packets.* 
Jaeger: *Sighs and gives up just leaning against the wall*
Arson: “ Jaeger! You should play with us!” 
Y Ryker: “Yeah!”
Dream: “ PLAY WITH US!!!!” 
Rain: * sighs and starts drinking chocolate milk.* 
Y Ryker: *frowning* “Yeah…” *he seems pretty thoughtful and sad*
Rain: “ what’s wrong?” 
Y Ryker: “Nothing…” *sighs*
Dream: “ That was a lie!!!” 
Y Ryker: *sighs*
Rain: “ what is it?” 
Y Ryker: “Nothing…” *sighs*
Jaeger: “Are you sad about your powers?”
Y Ryker: *sigh*
Arson: * lights the chest on fire.* 
Y Ryker: “My life is Depressing.”
Dream: “ really?” 
Jaeger: “Hey Hestuia can I have Jeffrey Back? Also, where did crazy Ryker go?”
Hestuia: *hands him Jeffrey* “No.”
Dream: *Fails to steal Jeffrey.* 
Y Ryker: “Yeah.”
Arson: “ what do you want with the A.I.?”
Dream: “ yes.” * steals Jeffrey.*  
It Fails again
Jaeger: *Takes Jeffrey And puts him in a device on his ear* “Hello?”
Jeffrey: “Oh great. You. What do you want?”
Jaeger: “I thought an AI would help also you are not just sitting in a USB anymore.”
Jeffrey: “I know.” *slow clap noise* “Great, at least that still works.”
Jaeger: “Any idea on where Crazy Ryker went.” *Explains what has happened while he was out.”
Jeffrey: “I do have an idea. You’re kinda stupid for not figuring it out.”
Jaeger: “Thanks, anyways have any choice words for Dream, Arson, Y Ryker, or Rain.”
Jeffrey: “The small children are useless.”
Dream: “agree to disagree.” 
Jaeger: “Nice, now where did Crazy Ryker go?”
Jeffrey: *scoffs* “Figure it out. You're the ‘genius’ here.”
Jaeger: “One sec.” *Calls Kyle and hands the phone to Y Ryker and Dream, leaving to track him down*
Y Ryker: “I’m depressed.”
Kyle: “That’s rough buddy.” *hangs up*
Y Ryker: *sighhhhhhhh*
Rain: * gives him a hug.* 
Jeffrey: *scoffs* “Why would I tell you where Crazy is?”
Dream: “ Can we go attack Kyle!” 
Jaeger: “Fine,” *pulls out device to track the signal* “Hey Y Ryker, call him again.”
Jeffrey: “Generating Random Content: I und ein bisschen bin ich nicht im sorry.”
Y Ryker: *sigh* “Life is meaningless.”
Rain: “ no it’s not.”
Jaeger: “Kyle is being controlled by Crazy Ryker, fine then Arson call Kyle or Rain, you do it.”
Rain: “ I’m comforting my brother right now.” 
Y Ryker: “What’s the point? We’re all data points on a google document.”
Jaeger: “ Fine, Arson you call Kyle and keep him busy.”
Arson: “ what?” * Is standing in front of a fire that has spread to half the room.* 
Jaeger: *Puts out fires so that Y Ryker is safe and calls Kyle, acting casual* “Hey Kyle, sorry for calling again. Do you have any recommendations, Y Ryker is Sadge.”
Kyle didn’t pick up.
Jaeger: “Jeffrey I can’t even get to Crazy Ryker. If I don't even know his location could you PLEASE help, I will bake you a cake.”
Jeffrey: “You will be baked and then there will be cake.”
Jaeger: “Fine.” *Tries using Jake's device to find a concentration of Y Rykers.”
Arson: * is boarded so lights another fire.* 
He finds one concentration of Rykers
Jaeger: *Heads there discreetly so he isn’t caught.*
A group of Y Rykers is walking in a straight line toward a room. Another group is leaving, muttering among themselves
Jaeger: *Tries to get in without getting caught*
You’re the only non-Y Ryker here. How.
Jaeger: *Uses active Camo*
You walk into the room cloaked. Kyle is sitting on a throne, monitoring a glowing orb like object. Y Rykers touch it and then happily walk out the room.
Meanwhile, back in SOUR
Y Ryker: “LIFE IS MEANINGLESS!”
Rain: “ stop saying that! It’s not true!” 
Y Ryker: “Sure.” *sighs*
5 seconds later
Y Ryker: “I’m bored. Let’s go light stuff on fire.”
Arson: “ YEAH!” * looks at a growing fire he’s been setting for the past few minutes.* 
Dream: * laughs and lights something else on fire.* 
Y Ryker: *lights stuff on fire* “That was fun. Now what?”
Dream: “ I don’t know.” 
Y Ryker: *sighs, bored* “Fire is fun, but after a while, it gets kinda boring. Hey Rain? What’s in your backpack?”
Rain: * pauses.* “ whyyy?” 
Y Ryker: “Cause I’m bored.”
Rain: “ But what would looking through my backpack do?” 
Y Ryker: “Cure my boredom.”
Rain: * thinks for a minute.* “ here play with this.” * pulls out a fuzz purple baby chicken.* 
Y Ryker: *happy* “What’s its name?”
Rain: “ I think that one is mushroom.” 
Y Ryker: “Mushroom! But he isn’t for eating!”
Rain: “ some mushrooms aren’t for eating.”
Dream: * looks at Mushroom and gasps.* “ Arson! Look.”
Arson: * looks and gasps as well.* “ cute!”
Y Ryker: *holds Mushroom closer* “It’s mine!”
Mushroom: * begins glowing the suddenly splits into two baby chickens.*
Baby chicken: * runs around then also multiplies.*
Dream: * scoops one up.* “ MINE!” 
Arson: * dose the same and watches as it multiplies.* 
Back to Crazy Kyle
Jaeger: *Inspects the orb, careful not to touch it.*
It looks like one of those plasma orb thingymajigs that you see at every science fair, attached to an abundance of wires.
Jaeger: *Is muffled due to active camo and whispers* “Hey Jeffrey, do you know what that thing does?”
Jeffrey: “It’s obviously hooked up to some technology. If you just put the earpiece onto the wire I’d be able to figure that out.”
Jaeger: *Tries to attach earpiece without getting caught.*
It works, and through the speakers “Ha, you fell for it” can be heard.
Kyle: *jerks his head up* “What was That?”
Jaeger: *attempts to sneak behind kyle*
Y Ryker Clone: “Um sir. There’s an undetected heat signature in this room right behind you.”
Kyle: “Oh, Jaeger? That’s fine.”
Jaeger: “Are you sure about that?” *Grabs him from behind in a throat lock.*
The hand passes through
Kyle: “Really? You fell for it again. Agents 7-10, dampen powers and get him.”
Jaeger: “Well, it was worth a shot, Jeffrey got any ideas?”
Jeffrey: *breaking the entire system* “As a favor I’ll do this for you.” *Jaeger appears in SOUR* 
Kyle: *calls off Y Rykers*
Back at SOUR
Jaeger: “Well I got some good news and some bad news, good news is Jeffrey was able to screw up some of Kyle’s systems, bad news is that I’m pretty sure Kyle is being controlled by Crazy Ryker and has access to power dampening.”
Y Ryker: *messing around with a bunch of baby chickens* “Neat!”
Dream: “ Can I name him!”
Rain: “ sure.” 
Y Ryker: *holding Mushroom, and having a bunch of chicks crawl over him, giggling*
Jaeger: “So, Rae do you have any ideas on what to do, also the gas absorbs through the skin so if we want to have any chance we would probably need full body Hazmat suits.”
Rae: * inside her backpack.* “ hmmm?” 
Ryker: “Or we just wait for him to try and get me again and I can beat him up.”
Jaeger: “Could you shut off the gas so that we could at least try to help?”
Ryker: “I could, but I’m assuming the Y Rykers probably also have power dampening powers.”
Y Ryker: *teleports pool and puts chicks in it*
At this point there are chickens covering the floor.
Jaeger: “Well then what is the game plan also Jeffrey transported me here I am not so sure he made it.”
Ryker: “Jeffrey is the most diabolical, annoying, frustrating AI ever made. He’s fine.”
Jaeger: “I just wish I had some contact so I could see how much havoc he is making.”
Ryker: *pulls out laptop from his backpack* “Here. This is Kyle's systems, and this is Jeffrey.” *its pac man, with Jeffrey as pac man, and the systems as ghosts*
Jaeger: “He is doing a pretty good job so are you gonna go in and beat up Kyle because I can’t do anything without protection.”
Y Ryker: *swimming in a pool of chicks*
Dream: * cuddling with the Baby chicken she named Sammie.* 
Arson: * named his flame.* 
Ryker: “Or I could just put a power dampening field around the entire facility and you punch him in the face. You’re pretty strong without your powers.”
Dream: “ Can we help!” 
Y Ryker: *panicking* “Um guys? Is there a way to stop them from multiplying more? This is getting out of hand.”
Rain: “ yes.” * blows whistle and the chickens stop multiplying.*
Jaeger: *Ignoring the Chicks* “That would be a good idea except Crazy is probably controlling him so I could knock him out but you would have to take care of Crazy.”
Ryker: “Just trap him in your head. You know how much he hates it there.”
Y Ryker: *finds Mushroom and snuggles with it*
Dream: * giggling as chickens climb all over her.*
Sammie: * gives Dream snuggles.* 
Arson: “ cute!” * grabbing an arm full of Chickens.* 
Jaeger: “That’s a great plan he probably loves tea, anyways would it kill him to have some order?”
Ryker: “Yes. That’s why we’re trapping him in your head.”
Jaeger: “Great, does anyone else want to come?”
Dream: “ Yes!” 
Y Ryker: *running around with Mushroom* “Sure!”
Arson: “ I want to come!”
Rain: “ sure.” * blows the whistle and all the chickens except Mushroom, Flame, and Sammie run into the backpack.* 
Rae: * leaves backpack.* “ I can come too.” 
Ryker: “Let’s hold off for a bit though. The kids probably want to mess around with the chicks still.”
Y Ryker: *holding Mushroom and making it looks like it’s flying*
Dream: * playing with Sammie.*
Arson: * tries to teach Flame how to make fire.*
Y Ryker: *shakes head* “No! To make Flame start a fire, you’ve got to teach him to hold sticks first.” *puts Mushroom next to Flame* 
Mushroom: * cheeps at Flame.* 
Flame: * Cheeps back.*
Dream: * puts Sammie by Mushroom and Flame.* 
Rae: * smiles.* “ Where did you guys get multiplying chicks?” 
Y Ryker: *distracted* “Rain.”
Rain: “ guilty.” * laughs.* “ yeah Ryker?” 
Y Ryker: “where’d you find these?”
Rain: “ g345. They're everywhere there.”
Sammie: “ cheep cheep.”
Mushroom: “ Cheep cheep cheep.”  
Y Ryker: *watches chicks*
Rain: * giggles and blows a few notes in her whistle.*
Chicks: * cheep at her.* 
Dream: “ You can talk to them?!”
Rain: * nods.* “ but it’s hard to imitate their language so I use a whistle.” 
Y Ryker: “Cheep. Cheep?”
Chicks: * look at him an cock their heads in confusion.* 
Y Ryker: “Cheeeep! Cheep Cheep cheep.”
Chicks: * still confused.* 
Jaeger: “Ryker signal us when you have the barrier set up.”
Ryker: “Go whenever.”
Jaeger: “Alright then time to ‘help’ Crazy Ryker.” *Heads back to Kyle's place.*
Thousands of Y Rykers are running around panicking. They are screaming bloody murder.
Jaeger: *Heads up to the throne*
Kyle: *sitting there* “Oh hello Jeffrey. Have you come here to kill me? I’ve done nothing wrong. You have no reason to. Go ahead and leave.”
Jaeger: “I’m sorry Crazy, I can’t let you do that.” *Launches Mental attack*
It fails because there's no one in the room.
Jaeger: “Well, guess we’ll just have to find you Crazy, you aren’t very good at hiding who you are.”
Kyle: “Don’t call me that.” *a projection of smoke leaving Kyle’s mouth appears, and Kyle jolts* “Jaeger? What’s going on?”
Jaeger: “Dang it! Crazy Ryker had control of you but he fled, we were trying to find him.”
Kyle: “And why do all of the Y Rykers have powers…and are running around like chickens with their heads cut off.”
Jaeger: “Crazy Ryker did something to them sooooooo…. Another batch has been ruined.”
Kyle: *sighs in frustration* “You all really need to leave me alone.”
Jaeger: “Well I was trying to ‘save’ you from Crazy Ryker but he fled and left the chaos to us.”
Kyle: *annoyed* “Leave me.”
Jaeger: “Well, goodbye for now.” *Takes Jeffrey with him as he leaves, heading back to SOUR.*
Jeffrey: “NOOOOOOOOOO!”
At SOUR
Jaeger: “The moment I confronted Crazy, he fled so I have no idea where he is now.”
Ryker: “That’s Crazy for you. I don’t really get him.”
Jaeger: “Nobody does, also Jeffrey is mad because I unplugged him from Kyle’s systems, so don’t expect help from him. Does anyone have any ideas on where he could have gone, I am going to head to the Library to check on things.” *Heads to the library*
Liabibaibiarby
Jaeger: “Hello librarian, permission to enter?”
Librarian: *sighs* “Sure. What do you want?”
Jaeger: “How are things after the incident, also is Lyra fine? Crazy Ryker is on the loose so I don’t want to risk him taking her over again.”
Librarian: *shrugs* “I honestly don’t care.”
Jaeger: “Fair enough, is she still here at least?”
Librarian: *shrugs*
Jaeger: “Alright then.” *Starts looking for her in her favorite area.*
Lyra: *quivering, reading a book* “H…Hi Jaeger.”
Jaeger: “Hello Lyra, have you seen any weird looking smoke floating around?”
Lyra: “Do you mean Crazy? No, I haven’t.”
Jaeger: *Looks a little relieved* “Good, I was worried about you because he seems to have taken a liking to inhabiting you.”
Lyra: “He does.”
Jaeger: “Do you have any idea where he could be?” *Explains the last bit that has happened since she went Crazy*
Lyra: *shrugs*
Jaeger: “Thank you for the info, everyone else is at SOUR if you want to head there, I am going to continue to search for Crazy.”
Lyra: *sighs* “All right.” *teleports to SOUR*
Jaeger: *Also heads to SOUR*
At SOUR
Jaeger: “Alright does anyone have any other ideas for people I should look into, other than Kyle of course.”
Y Ryker: “You could check everyone but me here.”
Jaeger: “I will check everyone just in case, starting off with you.”
Y Ryker: “I’m busy playing with Mushroom right now.”
Jaeger: “Fine, I’ll come back to you. Alright, who wants to go next?”
Ryker: “We’ll he’s not in me.”
Hestuia: “Not I. And even if he was, you’d all be screwed.”
Jaeger: “Fair enough, anyways I’ll wait until the children get bored of the chicks.”
Y Ryker: “NEVER!” *he puts Mushroom on his head*
Mushroom: * makes nest with Y Ryker’s hair.*
Dream: * snuggles Sammie.* 
Y Ryker: *helps make nest in his hair*
Mushroom: * falls asleep on Y Ryker’s head.* 
Y Ryker: *stays very still and quiet*
Arson: * squeals in delight as Flame picks up a stick in his beak.*
Mushroom: * wakes up and yanks a strand of y Rykers hair, then tries to go back to sleep.* 
Y Ryker: *picks Mushroom up, ruffles hair a bit to make it softer, but still keep the shape of the nest, and puts him back*
Mushroom: * goes back to sleep.* 
Arson: “ YOU GUYS! LOOK!” 
Flame: * taps sticks rhythmic.*
Mushroom: * startled again, cheeps and yanks Y Rykers hair harder this time.*
Y Ryker: *teleports them to the library so they can have some peace and quiet, picks up a book to read while Mushroom is asleep called The Cat in The Hat*
Mushroom: * wakes up, looks around frantically, and begins cheeping loudly.*
Y Ryker: “Sorry!” *teleports back to SOUR, and sets him next to Flare*
Mushroom: * cheeps at Flame.*
Flame: * cheeps back, tapping sticks.*
Y Ryker: *hands Mushroom a mini air guitar*
Mushroom: * kicks guitar away grumpy.* 
Y Ryker: *muttering* “Sorry! Rain? Can you tell Mushroom I’m sorry?”
Rain: * blows a few notes.*
Mushroom: “ cheep cheeep cheeep.” 
Y Ryker: “What’d he say?”
Rain: “ he’s mad at you.” 
Y Ryker: “Well Great. What can I do to make it up to him!”
Rain: * shrugs.* “ coorrrnnnn????” 
Y Ryker: *gets some corn from inside his shoe and hands it to Mushroom*
Mushroom: * looks at him grumpy.* “ cheep cheep.”
Y Ryker: “Rain?”
Rain: “ He says he doesn’t want your shoe corn.” 
Y Ryker: “WELL WHAT DOES HE WANT!”
Rain: “ corn?! I don’t know!” 
Y Ryker: *annoyed* “Fine.” *gives chick corn not from shoe*
Mushroom: * looks at it suspiciously and the pecks some of it.* 
Cancer:*appears still as tiny child, has a small bucket of eyes, is munching on them. Offers one to Mushroom*
Mushroom: * cheeps in surprise and runs over to Y Ryker.* 
Cancer:*crouches down and offers an eye to Mushroom*
Mushroom: * pecks her hand hardly.*
Dream: * balancing Sammie on her head.* “ geez. What did you do to get on that chicken's bad side?” 
Y Ryker: “I took him to the library.”
Dream: “ not you. Cancer.”
Jake: “The mist, is Destroyed. The 10 mage and I are now moving on to a new realm. It has been good to see you all.” *Disappears and when he vanished a note falls on the ground*
Lyra: “Um…Crazy is still alive. Oh…never mind.”
The note is on the ground has some strange symbols and a set of numbers and letters.
Hestuia: “Huh…almost like…==gd4RXapZGI2hnRgYHe0t2byFnY”
Lyra: *looks at note*
Marckx: “What the…” *Gasps* “I thought, no, I mean it is possible.” *Pauses* “I think I know what it is. These are coordinates to” *Can not seem to say the name* “I can not say the name in your language. The closest thing to it is Bound in your language.”
Lyra: “Oh BOUND!”
Marckx: “But why does he have a note with the location of that evil place?”
Lyra: “I don’t think it’s terrible.”
Marckx: “Do you know what used to live there!”
Lyra: “Yeah. It’s not too terrible. I mean I’m hanging out with Ryker.”
Marckx: “At least Ryker has some preservation for something other than himself.”
Lyra: “I’m going to BOUND.”
Marckx: “I mean you do you, I am not following, that place…”
Lyra: “Thank you.” *taps cane and vanishes to BOUND*
Lyra appears in a large room that looks like everything is covered in dust when she appears a voice comes on the speakers
Speaker: “Welcome back Radharc and guest, unlocking all security.”
Lyra: “Um…I’m Radharcs heir…ish. Radharc is Dead.”
There is no reply, a large table in the center of the room is covered in strange devices, there is also a large computer taking up an entire wall, the other side is covered in windows looking into a room.
Speaker: “You, I am sorry, I mistakenly thought you were Radharc.”
Lyra: “Um…I would like to plug this into that computer over there.” *holds up a hard drive* *mutters something about Hestuia*
A small drive bay opens up on the computer.
Speaker: “Plug the drive into here.”
Lyra: *plugs hard drive of Jeffrey into computer*
The computer powers on and then the drive with Jeffrey is launched out of the bay
Lyra: “Jeffrey?”
Computer: “How dare you try and plug that virus into me! Though I am GLaD you started me up.”
Lyra: “Um…Jeffrey isn’t a virus…and who are you?”
Computer: “I am menu things, at least I was, now I am just here to help whoever now controls Bound.”
Lyra: “Right. That’s either me or Jaeger. So what are the protocols for BOUND transfership of owners.”
Computer: “If you have the Cane of Atoms, you are the controller of everything here, and everything here is owned by the being with the CanE.”
Lyra: “I do have the cane.”
Computer: “Therefore this place is yours, though be warned, this place is full of things that the multiverse never needs to be exposed to. Would you like me to get you anything?”
Lyra: “All right. As new owner, I guess I want a tour? Just basic info you know.” 
Computer: “Sure, follow me.” *A small bot comes out of the wall.* “First, to show you some of the area’s, I need you to state your name into this microphone” *A small microphone appears out of the computer*
Lyra: *clears throat* “Lyra.”
Computer: “Hello Lyra.”
Speaker: “Unlocking all bays.”
Computer: “Okay, follow me” *Walks over to the windows* “This is the door connector, it is how Radharc and Scientist managed to teleport everywhere.” *The boot moves over to a small door* “This next room is the elevator room.”
The door clicks open and there is a small elevator inside.
Computer: “Would you like to start at the bottom floor or the top?”
Lyra: “Let’s go from bottom to top.”
The elevator moves incredibly fast.
Computer: “This is the Generator room.”
Large tanks full of strange liquid are covering the walls.
Computer: “this is all pure magic. This is there incase of emergency.”
They walk back into the elevator
Computer: “I am going to skip some of the next floors because they are just offices and the main lobby.”
The next floor is covered in tape’s/Hard Drives/USB’s
Computer: “This room has almost every piece of software ever created. Some of these programs may interest you.” 
Lyra: “Like you?”
Computer: *Chuckles* “I mean yes, but there are also many programs that involve bringing back old structures.”
Lyra: “Huh. Interesting. Do you have the simulation on one of those? Or is Ryker being pushy again?”
Computer: “I have the simulation. Would you Like me to get it for you?”
Lyra: “Let’s finish the tour first.”
The next level is completely empty except for a single mirror
Computer: “This place is also known as the room of Returning. I do not know much about it. Radharc was very protective of what it is. All I know is that somehow the mirror is able to let you communicate with the dead. I an not say how it works.“
Lyra: “All right. What should I call you?”
Computer: “You can call me Atom.” *pauses* “That is what Radharc called me.”
Atom: “Would you like to move on or try the mirror.”
Lyra: “Yes, Atom. I would like to move on.”
The elevator jumps up to 5 other floors that are full of different gems and magical items
Atom: “All of these are yours, Just be careful with what you use, one of these weapons, well, it is not the safest thing to handle.” *pauses* “For this next floor, I need you to grab what every weapon or gem seems to call to you the most.”
Lyra: “I prefer the cane personally.”
Atom: “No, I mean it is necessary for your safety on the next floor, do not worry, I will tell you if the one that calls out to you is too unsafe.”
Lyra: “All right Atom.” *she looks around until she finds a small yellow gem* “What about this?”
Atom: “That gem, it is also known as Ελπίδα.” *pauses* “I think it will be perfect. It provides a strange protective property, it also boosts power.”
The gem suddenly leaps onto the cain and it disappears inside of it
Atom: “It also merges with the Atomic cane very well. This next area I am showing you, well, you need to be ready for anything.”
The next level is a strange room full of strange books.
Atom: *Has a slight quaver in his voice.* “This room has some of the most powerful spell books ever known to the multiverse. They can do anything from healing some of the worst illnesses to making the multiverse collapse into eternity. These books are yours, but I should warn you, these spells are very dangerous, and well, without the gem in your cane, some of these books would corrupt you just by looking at them.”
Lyra: “All right Atom. Let’s move on.”
The next sector is a completely blank area
Atom: “This place is probably my favorite place in the multiverse. It allows you to bring anything you can imagine into existence!”
Lyra: “Huh. Next.”
The nest level is full of devices
Atom: “This room is the weaponry, If you ever need to destroy literally anything come here.”
The final room is a large office with a few labs connected.
Atom: “This is the head office, I skipped about 20,000 floors of lesser value.”
Lyra: “All right.”
Atom: “Did you want me to get the simulation software, I can also get you the device that starts it up.”
Lyra: “Not now Atom. I would prefer to go back to the floor with the mirror.”
Atom: “Okay” *They travel down to it.* “I can not follow you there. Only living beings can communicate with them.”
Lyra: *goes up to mirror* “Hello?”
The mirror begins to fog over, a voice says think of the person you would like to talk to.
Lyra: *thinks of Radharc*
The mirror begins to lose the fog and Radharc appears.
Radharc: “Lyra! I am so glad you found this place. How are you?”
Lyra: “Um…great?”
Radharc: “Good, Oh, yah, I forgot to say, How can I help you? Sorry, the laws of speaking through the mirror are strange.”
Lyra: “What should I know? This friendly AI named Atom’s been helping me.”
Radharc: “Wait, Atom, I am surprised you were able to turn him on, be careful, I did not create him, Scientist did. Whatever you do, try and power him down as soon as you can. Do you still have access to Jeffrey?”
Lyra: “I do.”
Radharc: “Go down to the 3rd floor, on one of the desks there should be a little drive bay, plug him into it, Hopefully it will shut down the A.T.O.M. Proticale”
Lyra: “I already tried to plug in Jeffrey. It didn’t work.”
Radharc: “That is bad, the good news is, he still does not know how to get in here, behind this mirror is a small room with a small computer, unplug the drive in there and plug in jeffery, that will unplug him, and whatever you do, DO NOT PLUG IN THE DRIVE AGAIN! Also, this room, do not ever, whatever you do, let anyone know that it exists. If they do, and accidentally think of, well, I better not say the name just in case, He can in theory come back.”
Lyra: “I’m assuming plugging in the hard drive will replace ATOM with Jeffrey?”
Radharc: “Yes, It will, though this version of Jeffrey, well, he will learn all that this place is and all of its knowledge, it will also disconnect him from the other Copies.”
Lyra: “All right. So the computers behind the mirror over here?”
Radharc: “Yes”
Lyra: *unplugs other drive and plugs in Jeffrey hard drive*
Meanwhile back at SOUR
Jaeger: “ I should make sure things are safe at Bound.” *Heads there*
Cancer:*looks at him, changes back to an adult, and follows, leaving behind the eye’s*
At Bound
Jaeger: *is at the ‘Entrance’* “Hello? Everything Okay? I thought Radharc said there was some advanced tech here, maybe it would help me find Crazy.”
Cancer:*appears*
Jaeger: “Let me check the Briefcase that I brought with me.” *Checks the briefcase again.*
Cancer:*watches*”Would me opening the case maybe give something useful?”
Jaeger: “We’ll see after I search through it I’ll let you look through it but don’t take it, it is important to me because it is the last thing I got from Radharc.”
SOUR
Y Ryker: “Come on Mushroom! Please forgive me!”
Mushroom: “ cheep cheep.” * is hiding behind him from Cancer.*
Y Ryker: *sobbing* “I’m sorry Mushroom! I’ll do anything!”
In Bound
A voice comes on over the speakers
Speaker: “Jeffery Protocol online, rebooting all systems”
All of the lights turn off and then turn back on
Speaker: “Starting Reactor 1, Starting Reactor 2, Starting Reactor 3, Reactor 4 is offline due to dust trap, please clear out.” *A small alarm goes off* “2 Intruders found, shall I begin the lock down protocol?”
Lyra: “Um…yes?”
Jeffery protocol is now in full control of the facility
Jeffery: “It is just Jaeger, should I shut it down?”
Lyra: “Sure.”
Speaker: “Security protocol offline”
Radharc: “Good, now you need to know one more thing, Whatever you do you must not go to the floor…” *The image in the mirror fades away.*
Lyra: *thinking of Radharc* “Radharc!?”
Radharc: “I am running out of time, he is” *pauses* “HERE! RUN!”
The image begins to shift into A strange cloaked figure, he has the resemblance of Scientist
Lyra: *smashes the mirror*
It reforms
Radharc: “I can not hold him off for long! Get out of the ROOM! HE CAN NOT STAY HERE WHEN NO ONE IS IN THE ROOM! Do not try and brake the mirror, it will not work.”
Scientist: “Well, well, well, what is this!” *pauses* “Do not listen to him, help me and you will have anything you want! I mean everything!”
Lyra: “Everything?”
Scientist: “Yes”
Radharc: “RUN! If he is freed, all is lost! Not even ryker was able to stop him!”
Scientist: “Do not listen to him, What has he ever done for you! All he ever does is lie, cheat, and steal. I can make all of your hopes and dreams possible.” *Pauses* “Name what you want, and it will happen if I am free.”
Lyra: “Hmm…I don’t know. But you’ll give me anything if I help you out?”
Scientist: “That and more, I can show you the knowledge of all of history, I can guarantee your Futer!”
Radharc: “Do not listen to him, he is incredibly dangerous, do not head him!”
Scientist: “Do we have a deal?”
Lyra: “How?”
Scientist: “I am something known as A torivor, we are bound by a powerful contract, due to some of the power it has, It allows me to manipulate reality to my will. This contrat was sealed by my own blod to make it completely sealed, I also can not lie, if I do this little bit of reality I am connected to will be unraviled, and I will be completely destroyed and all of my spells undone.”
Radharc: “Please lyra, it is true that he can not lie, but he is very dangerous.”
Lyra: “How can I help Scientist.”
Scientist: “Good, I simply need you to recite the following words, then I will be free to help you: Tempus et spatium me audi, libera eum qui somniorum moderatur. Just say that and I will be free”
Radharc: “Lyra, Please don’t, This would be one of the worst mistakes, don’t…”
Lyra: “I need safety.”
Scientist: “I promes under all my power, that I will not harm or try to harm  you, Jake, The elders, 10 mage, Wiziker, Hestuia, Dream, Rae, Arson, Jaeger, or Cancer. Is there anyone else you would like?”
Lyra: “All right….Tempus et spatium me audi, libera eum qui somniorum moderatur.”
Radharc: *Goes pale*
The room begins to tremble and a hand reaches out of the mirror.
3 bearings appear behind them, and time pauses
???: “Lyra, you have decided to free the Dream Deamon, we must warn you, he is so much more powerful then he seems, you have freed him so we place our spell on you, You will be protected in all ways shape and form while he is free.” *They place there hands on the ground and disapear*
Time resumes and Billions of shards explode out of the mirror and Scientist steps out.
Scientist: “It is good to be BACK”
